generated when precipitation from rain and snowmelt events flows over land or impervious surfaces and does not percolate into the ground as the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces such as paved streets parking lots and building rooftops it accumulates debris chemicals sediment or other pollutants that can adversely affect water quality the primary method to control stormwater discharges is the use of best management practices bmps why is stormwater management importantunlike water that enters our municipal sewage system stormwater is not cleaned and treated at a wastewater plant before it reenters our streams and waterways stormwater runoff from roads and other impervious areas comes into contact with pollutants and allows those pollutants into our waters it is essential that municipalities put in place a focused stormwater management program swmp to combat polluted stormwater runoffpolluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through municipal

helpstart by creating stormwaterfriendly lawns and gardens when the amount of rain falling exceeds the lands ability to absorb it the result is stormwater runoff without treatment stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment runoff can carry chemicals metals bacteria viruses organic compounds and other pollutants directly into creeks lakes rivers and streams runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding even during a typical pennsylvania stormclearly then what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water that means everyone not just government plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries this summer homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens and lawns are stormwaterfriendly there are many ways you can protect water quality by preventing stormwater pollution including never dump anything in storm drains streams wetlands or lakesclean up pet wastereduce the use of herbicide pesticide and fertilizerrevegetate bare spots in your yard to reduce erosionreport illicit discharges to east brandywine townshiphave your septic tank pumped and inspected regularlycheck your car for leaks and recycle your motor oil properly dispose of yard wastethe stormwaterfriendly garden home gardens can contribute considerable nutrients and other pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly this mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticidesfertilizers instead of using chemical fertilizers give organic alternatives such as compost and manure a try compost a doityourself fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow when using organic fertilizers be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoffpesticides many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem if one is posing a problem however identify the exact pest you have and research the nonchemical alternatives to controlling it pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater possibly contaminate drinking supplies and hurt downstream ecosystemsthe stormwaterfriendly lawnthe following lawncare steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners set your mower height to inches or higher taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system which absorbs more water and prevents erosion deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property a mulchmower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn the clippings decompose quickly provide important nutrients for your lawn and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers if mulching with your clippings is not possible bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material thats created as a fertilizer later figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems however if your lawn is thin or has bare spots you may not have a choice since a dense vegetated cover is the most stormwaterfriendly lawn there are no onesizefitsall guidelines when it comes to fertilizer homeowners needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and ph and nutrient levels in fact soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from micronutrient deficiency a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate identifying your lawns needs first will reduce unnecessary applications create a healthier lawn faster and reduce your longterm costs if fertilizer is needed maximize the benefits of slowrelease nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications typically called water insoluble nitrogen or win on fertilizer bags slowrelease nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation this type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring instead of the fall to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season another tip homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in march to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after october fertilizing during a lawns dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active do not fertilize or use pesticides within to feet of a stream keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways also if you live near a stream consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead to learn more about these buffers visit wwwstormwaterallianceforthebayorg and click on structural bmps also when youre done applying fertilizer immediately sweep any granulated chemicals off hard surfaces and back onto your lawn your walkway driveway patio or local road is often a quick route to the drainage pipes that discharge into local streamsin the long run little actions such as taking a stormwaterfriendly approach to your garden and lawn will have a big impact as all of them work together to protect our waters qualitywhat is a watersheda watershed is the area of land that captures rain and snow then stores

pollutant discharge elimination system npdes ms4 stormwater program polluted stormwater runoff is a leading cause of damage to nearly percent of surveyed us water bodies over land or through storm sewer systems polluted runoff is discharged often untreated directly into local water bodies when left uncontrolled this water pollution can result in the destruction of fish wildlife and aquatic life habitats and threats to public health due to contaminated food drinking water supplies and recreational waterwaysmandated by congress under the clean water act the npdes stormwater program addresses the nonagricultural sources of stormwater discharges which affect our streams and rivers the program is designed to use npdes permits to require controls to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed by stormwater runoff into local water bodieshomeowners can help keep pollutants off the ground and out of stormwater use a commercial car wash or wash your car on your lawn or other unpaved surface check your car and other equipment for leaks and spills recycle used oil and other automotive fluids use pesticides and fertilizers sparingly avoiding application when the forecast calls for rain sweep up yard debris rather than hosing down areas compost or recycle yard waste when possible reduce the amount of paved area and increase the amount of vegetated area in your yard downspouts should be directed away from paved surfaces and onto lawns to increase infiltration locate your nearest storm drains and protect them from litter and debris when walking your pet remember to pick up the waste and dispose of it properly keep livestock away from stream banks and rotate animal grazing to prevent soil erosion only drain your swimming pool when a test kit does not detect chlorine

pollinator gardennative plants are plants that naturally exist in an area without human introduction they provide food and shelter for native animals and insects thathave evolved alongside them these gardens are so important because many insect and bird species can only survive when their host plant is available there is an alarming decline in birds that rely on these plants to raise their young one solution is to provide native plants in every yard because there are no longer areas of native plants in our current environment for these insects and animals to survive douglas w tallamys first book bringing nature home awakened thousands of readers to an urgent situation wildlife populations are in decline because the native plants they depend on are fast disappearing his solution is to plant more natives in his book tallamy takes the nest step and outlines his vision for grassroots approach to conservation he explains how homeowners everywhere can turn their yards into conservation

increased pollution reduced ground water supplies and lower stream flows during dry spellstraditionally stormwater has been seen as a nuisance to be collected and dumped into the nearest ditch or stream and disposed of unfortunately such an approach neglects the reality that most of us live or work downstream of someone else as a result our neighbors nuisance becomes our problem which in turn becomes a problem for our downstream neighborswhat is stormwater managementmanagement of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as flooding erosion and

the community about hazards associated with illegal discharges andimproperdisposalof wastewhat is illicit dischargefederal regulations define an illicit discharge as any discharge to the storm sewer system that is not composed entirely of stormwater there are exceptions to this rule firefighting activities landscape irrigation foundation drains waster from crawl space pumps etc sources of illicit discharges include sanitary wastewater failing septic systems car wash waste water improper disposal of householdtoxinsor improper use of pesticides and herbicides etcillicitdischarges enter the system wither through direct connections deliberate pipe hookups to the storm drain system or indirect connections spills collected by drain outlets or deliberate dumping down the storm drain these illicit discharges drain directly to the creeks and streams and may be loaded with a large amount of harmful and toxic substances these pollutants enter the aquatic system and degrade the water quality and threaten wildlife and human healthlondon grove township as well as many other communities in the southern pennsylvania region recently was required to obtain a permit from thepennsylvania department of environmental protection pa dep for its storm drainage system this permit required the township tolocateand map all stormwater piping and drainage ditch systems owned and maintained by the township the permit also requires the township to inspect thesedrainagesystems periodically to detect any illicit discharges from the systemswhat in the world is an illicit discharge simply stated an illicit discharge is something that is exiting a storm drainage pipe or drainage ditch that is not stormwater and potentially could pollute our streams examples of illicitdischargesthat would be typical for a community like ours are septic system overflows sanitary wastewater chlorinated pool water paints oil or other vehicle fluids etcwhile the township has inspected its drainagesystemthoroughly once since the permit was issued our inspectors can not be everywhere all the time if you happen to see something exiting a storm pipe orditchthat looks smells or feels like something other than stormwater please contact the township so we can track it to its source and keep our streams as clean and pure as possible to report an illicit discharge call ken battin at the township or send an email to kbattinlondongroveorgplease report illicit discharges to the township stormwater tipsauto carewashing your car at home on the driveway or street can send detergents and other contaminants through the storm sewer system it is best to wash your car at a commercial car wash where the wastewater is treated and recycled if you do wash your car at home do so near a grassy area where the water can infiltrate into the ground and never dump motor oil or antifreeze into the storm drain dispose of these at a local service station or approved recycling centeronly rain in the drainnever dump anything into a storm drain including oil paint soap debris and leaves storm sewers dont go to the sewer plant but discharge directly into streams you might be pouring oil into your

rocktopped hills and outcroppings marshy valleys and wildlife in abundance all draining into two watersheds the west and southwest portions draining into the white clay creekand the eastern part draining into the red clay creek most of the land is moderately sloping and somewhat rolling but the southern part is steeper with slopes breaking sharply into valleys the highest point is north of toughkenamon with an elevation of feet above mean sea level the low point of feet above mean sea level is found where broad run leaves the township in its southern boundarywhen the weather rains storms or snows the resulting stormwater drains intotwenty two recongnizable streamswhich are the headwaters for the townships two watersheds thered clay watershedand thewhite clay watershed about a third of the townships land drains into the red clay creek bordering the eastern side via the scarlet run and bucktoe creek on its western side the trout run egypt run walnut run and broad run drain the balance of new gardens stormwater into the white clay creek after leaving the township boundaries stormwater in the red clay and white clay creeks eventually merge south in new castle county delaware before draining into the christina river from there its stormwater passes by the mouth of the brandywine creek just before its final destination into the delaware river either through the red clay or white clay watershed new gardens stormwater meanders through more than miles of streams and rivers before finally mixing its contents with the tidal waters of the delaware bay new gardens original economy of tillage and dairy is almost gone today its surface is comprised of a patchwork of small wood lots streams ponds and fields interspersed and separated by residential industrial

recreation place for many nonresidentswhen the english and irish settled in new garden in the early 1700s the streams were clean and when it rained stormwater didnt severely impact the streams most of the stormwater runoff probably contained sediments and sewage from agricultural sources and was captured in woods wetlands and meadows before draining into nearby streams as the population and economy grew more sediments and manmade pollutants drained into its streams indeed by the mid20th century the townships streams were stinky from sewage and for the most part unhealthy habitats for fishsince the passage of the federal clean water act the township and its residents have significantly improved stream water quality sewer plants dont directly pipe treated effluent into the streams tillage agriculture is contoured thereby reducing sediment runoff residential and commercial development capture stormwater sediments and residents are more aware of the water quality issues fish kills dont occur instead trout fishing has returned to a limited extent to some streamstoday new garden streams do become cloudy with excessive sediments from stormwater runoff originating from nearby or upstream sources when the streams becomes clear and calm after a rain storm event its water quality may be appear clean it isnt the department of environmental protection routinely inspects segments of new garden streams for aquatic creatures sensitive to pollutants and sediments if the population of particular aquatic invertebrate is below a certain level the stream is considered impaired in

stormwater can runoff and end up in nearby streams rivers or other water bodies this runoff and the pollution it picks up as it flows is the main contributor to water quality pollution in chester countystormwater run offstormwater is any precipitation that flows over the ground that flows into a nearby river or streamtoo much rain not absorbed into the ground becomes stormwater runoff this can cause flooding stormwater runoff is also one of the major causes of water pollution in chester county pollutants such as soil and automotive fluid are carried off in the runoff this polluted runoff is not treated and flows to the nearest stream improving the management of stormwater runoff can be accomplished by finding ways to increase the amount of rainwater that can be absorbed into the ground at home your business and in your community and by preventing pollutants from entering the waterstormwater runs off roof tops driveways parking lots roadways sidewalks yards etc sometimes it flows directly into streams in developed areas this runoff drains to streets then enters storm drains flows through stormwater sewer pipes and eventually discharges to streams all particles such as trash cigarette butts pet waste lawn chemicals deicing salts and chemicals vehicle fluid droppings and everything else that accumulates on the pavements and land surfaces are carried by the stormwater into the streamsstormwater while running over pavement and parking lots can pick up pollutants before flowing into a nearby river or stream the precipitation of impervious surfaces such as roads parking lots and roofs can not soak into the ground through these surfaces impervious surfaces also increase the amount and speed water entering rivers and other water bodies which can increase the severity and frequency of floods destruction of fish and other water dependent species habitats anything that enters a stormfor more information check out the resources belowreducing storm water and

illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to an ms4 municipal separate storm sewer system that is not composed entirely of stormwater with some exceptions illicit discharges are considered illicit because ms4s are not designed to accept process or discharge such nonstorm water wastes sources of illicit discharges can include sanitary wastewater effluent from septic tanks improper oil disposal laundry wastewater spills from roadway accidents or improper disposal of auto and household toxins illicit discharges enter the system through either direct connection wastewater piping either mistakenly or deliberately connected to the storm drains or indirect connections infiltration into the ms4 from sanitary systems spills collected by drain outlets paint or used oil dumped directly into a drain the result is untreated discharges that contribute high levels of pollutants including heavy metals toxins oil and grease solvents nutrients viruses and bacteria to receiving water bodies pollutant levels from these illicit discharges have been shown in epa studies to be high enough to significantly degrade receiving water quality and threaten aquatic wildlife and human health not all discharges are illicit including water line flushing foundation drains springs air conditioning condensation flows from wetlands etc for more information on illicit discharges and report potential discharges please refer to the townships report form for illicit discharges below illicit discharges and connections reporting form kb files stormwater outreach materials and reference documentsstormwater pollution from point sources and nonpoint sources is a challenging water quality problem unlike pollution from industry or sewage treatment facilities which is caused by a discrete number of sources stormwater pollution is caused by the daily activities of people everywhere rainwater and snowmelt run off streets lawns farms and construction and industrial sites and pick up fertilizers dirt pesticides oil and grease and many other pollutants on the way to our rivers lakes and coastal waters stormwater runoff is our most common cause of water pollution because stormwater pollution is caused by so many different activities traditional regulatory controls will only go so far education and outreach are key components to any successful stormwater programnational menu of stormwater best management practicesthe national menu of best management practices for stormwater phase ii was first released in october epa has renamed reorganized updated and enhanced the features of the website these revisions include the addition of new fact sheets and revisions of existing fact sheets because the field of stormwater is constantly changing epa expects to update this menu as new information and technologies become available therefore epa invites you to submit comments on the existing fact sheets and suggest additional fact sheet subjectsstormwater informationin the pennsylvania state department of environmental protection pa dep began a stormwater management program called the ms4 in urbanized and developing areas of the state so that the townships could better monitor and manage the pollutants that enter our waterways as a result of stormwater runoff south coventry township was selected to participate in this program because of our proximity to pottstown which is an urbanized area as well as the fact that it is a developing community and has exceptional value streams as a result the township has created this portion of the website to educate our residents about this issue we hope that you not only find the information contained in these links as informative but that you also utilize the information to help us keep our local bodies of water of exceptional valuewhat npdes means to youcitizen involvement is an important part of the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit program citizen involvement occurs at the time of the initial state npdes authorization process through submission of public comments and participation at public hearings and may occur during any substantial program revision citizens may also participate in the federal rule making process where npdes program requirements are established citizen participation helps to ensure the npdes permit program is working effectively in every communitywashing the car can be lots of fun butdid you know it can benefit your lawn too its true just pull your car onto the grass and wash it there your lawn will gladly soak up the water plus the grass will break down the soap and absorb any phosphates for use as fertilizerkeeping soapy water out of storm drains and ditches protects water quality thats because anything that enters storm drains or ditches is headed straight for your local lake or river no filters no treatment if you cant wash your car on the lawn use a commercial car wash regulations require commercial car washes to collect

the number one cause of pollution or impairment in our local waterways polluted runoff is often transported through municipal stormwater systems where it is eventually discharged into streams untreated the environmental protection agency epa has established a municipal stormwater management program known as the ms4 program that is intended to improve our nations waters by reducing the quantities of pollutants that stormwater picks up and carries into the storm sewer systems during a storm event as part of the ms4 program pocopson township holds a permit to discharge its stormwater into local waterways this permit requires pocopson to design a stormwater management program that reduces the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent possible which protects water quality and which satisfies the water quality requirements of the clean water act in pennsylvania the ms4 program is administered by the department of environmental protection depthe ms4 stormwater management program has six elements termed minimum control measures which when implemented are intended to result in significant reduction in pollutants discharged into receiving waters the six minimum control measures and the actions required by pocopson township are outlined below public education and outreachdistribute educational materials and conduct outreach to inform citizens about the impacts that

pennsylvania department of environmental protection for its storm drainage system this permit required the township to locate and map all stormwater piping and drainage ditch systems owned and maintained by the township the permit also requires the township to inspect these drainage systems periodically to detect any illicit discharges from the systemswhat is an illicit discharge simply stated its something that is exiting a storm drainage pipe or drainage ditch that is not stormwater and potentially could pollute our streams examples of illicit discharges that would be typical for a community like ours are septic system overflows sanitary wastewater chlorinated pool water paints oil or other vehicle fluids etcwhile the township has inspected its drainage system on a regular basis since the permit was issued our inspectors cannot be everywhere all the time if you happen to see something exiting a storm pipe or ditch that looks smells or feels like something other than stormwater please contact the township so we can track it to its source and keep our streams as clean and pure as possible to report an illicit discharge call pocopson township at or send an email to

stormwater has some obvious impacts such as flooding and erosion some less obvious but equally important impacts of stormwater runoff include increased pollution reduced ground water supplies and lower stream flows during dry spellstraditionally stormwater has been seen as a nuisance to be collected and dumped into the nearest ditch or stream and disposed of unfortunately such an approach neglects the reality that most of us live or work downstream of someone else as a result our neighbors nuisance becomes our problem which in turn becomes a problem for our downstream neighborswhat is

car at a commercial car wash where the wastewater is treated and recycled if you do wash your car at home do so near a grassy area where the water can infiltrate into the ground and never dump motor oil or antifreeze into the storm drain dispose of these at a local service station or approved recycling centeronly rain in the drain never dump anything into a storm drain including oil paint soap debris and leaves storm sewers dont go to the sewer plant but discharge directly into streams you might be pouring oil into your own drinking waterpick up after your dog pet waste can be a major source of excess nutrients and bacteria to our streams always properly dispose of pet wastewhen your cars leaking oil on the street remember its not just leaking oil on the street leaking oil goes from car to street and is washed from the street into the storm drain and into our lakes streams and into coastal waters now imagine the number of cars in the area and you can imagine the amount of oil that finds its way from leaky gaskets into our water so please fix oil leaksresidential landscaping tipsdownspouts direct all downspouts away from pervious surfaces and onto lawns rain barrels can be used to collect water from downspouts making it available for wateringlawn care fertilizers and pesticides should be used sparingly when applied in excess these chemicals are washed off by rainwater and enter the local storm sewer system do not sweep yard waste and leaves into the street these add extra nutrients to streamsplant native trees and shrubs erosion of streambanks can be prevented through the use of vegetated strips along the banks also known as riparian buffers these strips of tall grasses trees and flowers act to stabilize banks which prevents erosion and additional sediment load in the stream click here for a native plant listrain gardens a specially designed rain garden can be planted with native vegetation to that will provide an area for rainwater to collect

is a program started in by the tredyffrin environmental advisory council and the te green team to take action on stormwater and water pollution in our township this volunteerled group has installed an educational rain garden at the tredyffrin public library and launched the residential rain garden program in rain gardens are excellent for areas like tredyffrin which has seen significant damage from stormwater fewer trees more impervious surfaces and a change in how much and how fast precipitation is falling all contribute to a rather expensive and unhealthy problem rain gardens can help by absorbing approximately more water than a typical lawn they also can help recharge the ground water by allowing more stormwater to filter through naturally they decrease the amount of stormwater running straight off of impervious surfaces into our streams which decreases the pollutants and salt in our stream water since they are planted using all native and deerresistant plants they also give local pollinators and wildlife places to thrive residents of tredyffrin can apply to receive a rain garden on their property residents will have a copay of $ and will have an obligation to take care of the garden for many years will have to display a sign will have to volunteer hours back to the program and more however the remaining cost of installing the garden will be covered by a grant the township received and with volunteer hours this is neighbors helping neighbors to solve a problem that affects us allthe fall application period is now openplease note that properties must meet certain requirements that include having appropriate soil slope and public visibility to receive a garden applicants who do not receive a rain garden will be encouraged to apply for our next round encouraged to volunteer so they gain the knowledge to install on their own and will be given educational resources to help them take action on stormwater and pollutionresidents who are interested in

compostingcomposting is the decomposition of plant remains and other onceliving materials to make an earthy dark crumbly substance that is excellent for adding to houseplants or enriching garden soil it is the best most efficient way to recycle your yard and kitchen wastes and is a critical step in reducing the volume of garbage needlessly sent to landfills for disposal its easy to learn how to compostcomposting is not a new idea in the natural world this same process occurs as leaves pile up on the forest floor and begin to decay eventually the rotting leaves are returned to the soil where living roots can finish the recycling process by reclaiming the nutrients from the decomposed leaves today the use of composting to turn organic wastes into a valuable resource is expanding rapidly throughout the united states and in other countries as landfill space becomes scarce and expensive and as people become more aware of the impacts they have on the environment residents are encouraged to contribute to the composting revolution by recycling yard and kitchen waste on their own property your privately contracted trash hauler will also provide several dates in the fall which they pick up leaves and yard waste from your property however for those who are not able to do so the township provides a compost site at mill road malvern pafor residents of tredyffrin township and contractors

snow that runs off streets parking lots lawnsand other sites like other municipalities in pennsylvania oxford borough faces many stormwaterrelated challenges in developed areas impervious surfaces such as pavement and roofs prevent precipitation from naturally soaking into the ground instead water runs rapidly into storm drains sewer systems drainage ditches and eventually local waterways this runoff can causedownstream floodingonstreet floodingstream bank erosionincreased turbidity muddiness created by stirred up sediment from erosionhabitat destructioncombined storm and sanitary sewer system overflowsinfrastructure damagecontaminated streamthe increase in intense storms in recent years exacerbates this problem our impacts are not just local the borough is home to four different watersheds all of which flow into the chesapeake bay watershed after decades of stormwater runoff all our streams are impaired by pollution contributing to the pollution of the chesapeake according to the chesapeake bay foundationpennsylvania is the lynchpin of the chesapeake bay cleanup the state makes up the bulk of the susquehanna rivers watershed and the susquehanna supplies about percent of the freshwater that enters the bay the chesapeake bays ecosystem impacts the quality of the air we breathe the water we drink and the food we eat its wetlands protect communities from extreme weather such as erosion flood waters and storm surges and the trees that sprawl from the bay shores and forests cool our communities as an interconnected system the health of the bay impacts the health of regions far and wide including the people in themthe problem of pollution into the bay is so serious that the state of maryland is pursuing legal action against pennsylvania and the federal environmental protection agency has stepped in the pennsylvania department of environmental protection pa dep is working to address this problem by requiring individual municipalities to reduce the amount of stormwater they contribute to the bay this is an important initiative but the mandate leaves municipalities struggling to find ways to pay for new stormwater infrastructureeach municipality that meets certain pa dep criteria must create a pollutant reduction plan prp and then apply to pa dep for a permit to implement their prp and other stormwater management practices the prp outlines the best management practices bmps the borough will implement to reach the required pollutant reduction for this fiveyear permit cycle some examples of bmps included in our prp are bioretention rain garden fig a constructed wetland fig and tree trench and pervious sidewalk with underground storage fig these projects are meant to allow rainwater and snow melt to soak into the ground where it is naturally filtered before reaching underground aquifers and water ways some of the bmps in our prp were chosen as a result of public outreach completed while working with meliora design a green infrastructure design firm as a result of a grant award from the chesapeake bay trust green streets green jobs green towns g3 program the borough was able to hire meliora to identify a menu of projects throughout the borough two projects were chosen to take to completion rain garden bumpouts on mt vernon street and pervious sidewalk with underground storage at the oxford police station both of these projects are on boroughowned property making them easier to implementmt vernon street bumpouts projectpolice station tree trenchsidewalk storage projectfunding stormwater management and prp projectsconstructing the projects in our prp is estimated to cost the borough over $ the borough has only a fraction of this amount available for the construction and ongoing maintenance of the bmps so we must find other ways to fund them like other municipalities the borough was awarded american rescue plan act arpa funds we chose to apply a portion of this funding to help finance stormwater infrastructure anddeposited the funds in a new water resource protection fund the award will help but isnt enough to fund all of our projects and is not a recurring source of revenue to support ongoing maintenance and repair of our prp projects and other stormwater infrastructurewe have and will continue to apply for grants to support our prp projects we will also continue to explore other funding optionsin february the borough was awarded a $ grant through the chester county conservation districts c3ap nonag implementation program to support one of our stormwater bmp projects the c3ap program supports nonagricultural projects thatresult innutrientand sediment reduction to improve water quality andreduce pollution entering the chesapeake bay through a partnership with the community of love lutheran church the borough will constructa bioretention wetland project on church property with this funding this project is intended to be anexample of how the municipality and private property owners can work together to improve how we manage stormwater runoffand reduce pollutionthe borough is also looking for strategic partnerships with surrounding municipalities and agencies that may help reduce the cost to construct and maintain new stormwater projects adn to meet our state stormwater requirements the borough recently partnered with penndot to purchase stormwater reduction credits as part of penndots big elk creek streambank restoration project a portion of a stream flowing into the big elk creek in east nottingham township was slated to be restored and the engineers working on the project offered to have any municipality contributing pollution to the stream be part of the project the borough was able to purchase hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of credits for a little over $ vastly reducing the cost to the boroughpenndot big elk creek streambank restorationcommunity educationpublic education and outreach are required components of a stormwater management plan and the borough is partnering with the regional environmental advisory council eac to help with getting the word out the eac helped the borough with the g3grant application that resulted in the hiring of meliora design and with the dockstader award used to purchase and distribute rain barrels to residents the borough was able to purchase and distribute barrels rain barrels reduce the amount of stormwater going to our streams thus reducing pollutants they also help lower water and sewer bills how you can helpin addition to using rain barrels to reuse rainwater in gardens there are several ways you can help reduce your contribution to polluted stormwaterdisconnect downspouts that run to storm sewers and instead direct the water to a lawn your own rain garden or a planterplant a native treeshrub or two if your yard has enough room trees have many benefits including soaking up and dissipating rain cooling the earth and providing habitat you can find a list of native trees heretake power lines and sidewalks into consideration when planting trees you will want to plant smaller trees under power lines and please call before you dig some trees are less likely to push sidewalks up than others so if you want to plant closer to your sidewalk do your research before plantingreplace some of your perennials with native species to reduce stormwater native species have much more robust root systems that soak in more water than nonnatives they also provide muchneeded habitat and food for birds and pollinators such as bees you can find a list of native plants here the borough has created several native plant beds with the help of community volunteers and the penn state extensionthe effects of stormwater on residents and property ownerspollutionstormwater runoff carries pollutants such as oil dirt chemicals and lawn fertilizers directly to streams and rivers where they seriously harm water quality storm sewer systems concentrate runoff into smooth straight conduits this runoff gathers speed and erosional power as it travels underground when this runoff leaves the storm drains and empties into a stream its excessive volume and power blast out streambanks damaging streamside vegetation and wiping out aquatic habitatfloodingheavy rains have gotten more frequentand intensein the united statesover the past years with climate change making matters worse and increasing the risk of flooding and sewer system overflows indeed the average size of a year floodplain is likely to increase percent by centurys end according to the epa another growing problem isurban flooding caused simply by too much rain on impervious surfaces not by storm surges or overflowing bodies of water urban floods can destroy neighborhoods green infrastructure reduces flood risks and bolsters theclimate resiliencyof communities by capturing rain where it falls and keeping it out of sewers and waterwayswater supplymore than halfof the rain that falls in urban areaswhich are covered mostly by impervious surfacesends up as runoff green infrastructure practices reduce runoff by capturing stormwater and allowing it to recharge groundwater supplies or be harvested for purposes like landscaping and toilet flushing that reduces demand on municipal water supplies even more important because of decreased rainfall reduced snowpack and earlier snowmelt brought on bydroughtand hotter temperatures that can come with climate changestormwater reduction is needed because of state mandates environmental concerns and flooding concerns the borough continues
