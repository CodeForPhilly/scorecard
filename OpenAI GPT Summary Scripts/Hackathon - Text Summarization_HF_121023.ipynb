       "What is Stormwater?\n",
       "\n",
       "Stormwater runoff is generated when precipitation from rain and snowmelt events flows over land or impervious surfaces and does not percolate into the ground. As the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces such as paved streets, parking lots, and building rooftops it accumulates debris, chemicals, sediment or other pollutants that can adversely affect water quality. The primary method to control stormwater discharges is the use of best management practices (BMPs). \n",
       "\n",
       "Why is Stormwater Management Important?\n",
       "\n",
       "Unlike water that enters our municipal sewage system, stormwater is not cleaned and treated at a wastewater plant before it re-enters our streams and waterways. Stormwater runoff from roads and other impervious areas comes into contact with pollutants and allows those pollutants into our waters. It is essential that municipalities put in place a focused Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) to combat polluted stormwater runoff.\n",
       "\n",
       "Polluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s), from which it is often discharged untreated into local waterbodies. To help to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped into an MS4, operators must obtain a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit through the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and develop a stormwater management program.\n",
       "\n",
       "MS4...� What�s�That?\n",
       "\n",
       "A Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) is any municipal-owned stormwater conveyance or system of conveyances. i.e. Township roads, ditches/swales, and stormwater pipes.� East Brandywine Township has to comply with the NPDES MS4 permit through 6 Minimum Control Measures (MCMs):\n",
       "\n",
       "MCM #1�Public Education & Outreach - East Brandywine Township has made efforts to educate the public about the Stormwater Management Program through several methods, including: the Township website, the Township newsletter, Mile Marker, and the partnership with the Brandywine Valley Association (BVA).\n",
       "\n",
       "MCM #2�Public Involvement/Participation - East Brandywine Township encourages the public to participate in the stormwater management program decision-making process and routinely communicates with the BVA. The Township�s MS4 Annual Reports are available to the public for review by request. \n",
       "\n",
       "MCM #3�Illicit Discharge Detection & Elimination - East Brandywine Township maps all of its stormwater features, including: outfalls, surface waters, roads, inlets, pipes, basins, etc. Illicit discharges to the MS4 are prohibited in East Brandywine Township. Outfalls are inspected regularly to verify that there are no illicit discharges and to take the appropriate actions if an illicit discharge is discovered. Examples of illicit discharges include: substances (such as used motor oil, etc.) that have been dumped into a storm sewer or waterbody, wastewater piped directly from a home to the storm sewer, failing septic systems, etc. \n",
       "\n",
       "MCM #4�Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control - East Brandywine Township and the Chester County Conservation District (CCCD) ensure that construction sites have adequate Erosion and Sedimentation (E&S) Control Best Management Practices (BMPs) and maintain them throughout the duration of the project to prevent accelerated erosion and sedimentation to the MS4.\n",
       "\n",
       "MCM #5�Post Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and Re-Development - East Brandywine Township and the CCCD ensure adequate Post Construction Stormwater Management (PCSM) BMPs are proposed and installed properly. Once construction of these BMPs is complete, East Brandywine Township regularly inspects the PCSM facilities to ensure that they are functioning properly. \n",
       "\n",
       "MCM #6�Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping � East Brandywine Township has identified all Township-owned facilities and activities (fleet vehicle maintenance, winter de-icing, etc.) that have a potential to impact stormwater and developed an Operations and Maintenance Program to prevent stormwater pollution. Township employees are regularly trained in all aspects of the Stormwater Management Program.\n",

       "What is East Brandywine Township Required to Do?\n",
       "\n",
       "The stormwater requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) are administered under the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and implemented by DEP through the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) Program. Almost all municipalities (including East Brandywine) in Pennsylvania must have an MS4 permit.\n",
       "\n",
       "East Brandywine Township must comply with its MS4 permit through a robust stormwater management program. For more information on the MS4 program go to DEP�s MS4 Resource Page.

       "How Can You Help?\n",
       "\n",
       "Start by creating stormwater-friendly lawns and gardens! When the amount of rain falling exceeds the land�s ability to absorb it, the result is stormwater runoff. Without treatment, stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment. Runoff can carry chemicals, metals, bacteria, viruses, organic compounds, and other pollutants directly into creeks, lakes, rivers, and streams. Runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding � even during a typical Pennsylvania storm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Clearly, then, what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water. That means everyone, not just government, plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries. This summer, homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens and lawns are �stormwater-friendly.� \n",
       "\n",
       "There are many ways you can protect water quality by preventing stormwater pollution including:\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       " Never dump anything in storm drains, streams, wetlands, or lakes.\n",
       "Clean up pet waste.\n",
       "Reduce the use of herbicide, pesticide and fertilizer.\n",
       "Re-vegetate bare spots in your yard to reduce erosion.\n",
       "Report illicit discharges to East Brandywine Township.\n",
       "Have your septic tank pumped and inspected regularly.\n",
       "Check your car for leaks and recycle your motor oil.\n",
       " Properly dispose of yard waste.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Stormwater-Friendly Garden\n",
       " \n",
       "Home gardens can contribute considerable nutrients and other pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly. This mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticides.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fertilizers: Instead of using chemical fertilizers, give organic alternatives, such as compost and manure, a try. Compost, a �do-it-yourself� fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings, contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow. When using organic fertilizers, be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoff.\n",
       "\n",
       "Pesticides: Many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem. If one is posing a problem, however, identify the exact pest you have and research the non-chemical alternatives to controlling it. Pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater, possibly contaminate drinking supplies, and hurt downstream ecosystems.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Stormwater-Friendly Lawn\n",
       "\n",
       "The following lawn-care steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners:\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       " Set your mower height to 3 inches or higher. Taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system, which absorbs more water and prevents erosion. Deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them.\n",
       " Keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property. A mulch-mower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn. The clippings decompose quickly, provide important nutrients for your lawn, and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration. Using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers. If mulching with your clippings is not possible, bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material that�s created as a fertilizer later.\n",
       " Figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn. Foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems. However, if your lawn is thin or has bare spots, you may not have a choice since a dense, vegetated cover is the most stormwater-friendly lawn. There are no one-size-fits-all guidelines when it comes to fertilizer. Homeowners� needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and pH and nutrient levels. In fact, soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from �micronutrient deficiency,� a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate. Identifying your lawn�s needs first will reduce unnecessary applications, create a healthier lawn faster, and reduce your long-term costs.\n",
       " If fertilizer is needed, maximize the benefits of slow-release nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications. Typically called �water insoluble nitrogen,� or WIN, on fertilizer bags, slow-release nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation. This type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring, instead of the fall, to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season. Another tip: Homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in March to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after October. Fertilizing during a lawn�s dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active.\n",
       " Do not fertilize or use pesticides within 15 to 20 feet of a stream. Keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways. Also, if you live near a stream, consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead. To learn more about these buffers, visit www.stormwater.allianceforthebay.org and click on �Structural BMPs.� Also, when you�re done applying fertilizer, immediately sweep any granulated chemicals off hard surfaces and back onto your lawn. Your walkway, driveway, patio, or local road is often a quick route to the drainage pipes that discharge into local streams.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the long run, little actions, such as taking a stormwater-friendly approach to your garden and lawn, will have a big impact as all of them work together to protect our water�s quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "What is a watershed?\n",
       "\n",
       "A watershed is the area of land that captures rain and snow, then stores, filters, seeps, or drains this water into a common waterbody (marsh, stream, river or lake). A watershed includes the network of streams that drains that surface land area and the groundwater and aquifers located underground that contribute water to those streams.\n",
       "\n",
       "East Brandywine Township has three main subwatersheds: Beaver Creek, Culbertson Run, and East Branch Brandywine Creek. Both Beaver Creek and Culbertson Run drain into East Branch Brandywine Creek. East Branch Brandywine flows into Brandywine Creek, which is part of the larger Christina River Basin, and ultimately the Delaware Bay. \n",

       " The Open Space Committee was created by the Board of Supervisors in 2002, with the charter to help identify potential open-space properties and explain the conservation options to those property owners. It also works with the Board of Supervisors and township administration to develop procedures to maintain and acquire open space.\n",
       "In November 2002, East Brandywine voters, by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, approved a referendum to increase the Earned Income Tax by one-eighth of 1% to finance the preservation of open space within the township. Based on this dedicated funding source, the township supervisors floated a bond issue in 2003 that included $3 million dedicated for open space preservation expenditures.\n",
       "In 2004, after months of negotiation, the first payoff from the voter-approved plan to preserve open space became a reality. Using grants from the Chester County Preservation Partnership program totaling approximately half of the purchase price and Open Space Funds, the township purchased the conservation easement on 39 acres of fields and woods fronting Dowlin Forge and Rock Raymond Roads. As part of the deal, the township also purchased a nearby two-acre lot on Dowlin Forge Road for future trail access and a small park.� Since then, the Township has acquired 7 more property easements and 2 additional fee simple properties. The total land preserved through the Open Space Program is over 200 acres.� State and county grants have covered almost half of the cost of preserving this land.\n",

       "Current ActivitiesBecause of the sensitivity of its discussions with landowners, most of the Open Space Committee's deliberations take place in executive session. As a result, there has been little publicity about its work. �The committee is always interested in considering proposals from residents who wish to preserve their land. �Please contact Township Staff at (610) 269-8230 so they may direct your inquiry to the Committee.Open Space Committee representatives also attend township Planning Commission meetings to provide feedback on new development proposals, and encourage adoption of open space-friendly ordinances that allow development to the same density, but promote more creative use of a property to preserve open space elements such as the view shed. �In 2010 the Growing Greener Ordinance was passed. �It was based on the Natural Lands Trust Growing Greener Model Ordinance.\n",

       "About the Parks & Recreation CommitteeThe Parks and Recreation Committee advises the Board of Supervisors on the development and maintenance of East Brandywine Township's three park sites: the Community Park on Dilworth Road; Spatola Park on Raleigh Drive, and Hopewell Field on Township Road. The volunteers of this committee also host events and fund-raisers for park improvements. �A fourth park, Bondsville Mill Park, opened to the public in 2015 and its development is being overseen by a separate committee.Opportunities for active recreation, in the form of youth leagues for team sports, are created and managed by the East Brandywine Youth Association (EBYA) an independent non-profit organization that enjoys priority access to, and shares in the maintenance of, the Township's athletic fields.East Brandywine is one of eight municipal members that, along with the Downingtown Area School District, comprise the Downingtown Area Recreation�Consortium (DARC). DARC is a regional municipal recreation organization thatoffers recreation, adult education, and youth learning opportunities. The Township contributes financially to the administrative and program costs; user fees also are charged to cover operating costs of DARC's various programs.HistoryThe East Brandywine Parks and Recreation board was created in 1990.�The Brown family, who owned a farm on Dilworth Road, approached the Township and asked if the community would like to buy some of the land,� recalls Jimm Worrell, a founding member of the Board. �The Township agreed to buy 10 acres.� The agreement said that it could later buy more. �This was the beginning of today�s Community Park, which extended to today�s 60-plus acres in two further steps.At the time, the Township already owned two parks:�Spatola Park on Raleigh Drive,�and Hopewell Field on Township Road. With the addition�of a third park, the Township�decided it needed a separate�body to oversee all three, and�so the Park & Recreation Board came�into being with an initial eight�members.\n",

       "The East Goshen Township Department of Parks and Recreation manages over 500 acres of park space, is a steward for conservation efforts and offers programs, activities and events that increase the quality of life for Township residents. Simply put, it is �In the Business of Making Memories�.�� The department has experienced tremendous growth and success in recent years, increasing programmatic hours by over 500% since 2014. To meet current and future resident needs, the department has identified walkability as a chief strategic goal. We�re proud to have received over $3.6M in grant funding to support the construction of the upcoming Paoli Pike Trail project. It will connect the many land uses lining Paoli Pike, allowing park users to safely navigate Township facilities, offer students a safe route to school, and support our local community businesses. Park land is anchored by East Goshen Township Park, a 55-acre active park made lovely by rolling hills with vistas crossing over to its sister passive park, Applebrook Park, a 98 �acre passive park framed by Ridley Creek. East Goshen Township Park has a full complement of recreational facilities: baseball, softball and soccer fields; a multi-use field, a sand volleyball court, three tennis courts and two pickleball courts; two full-size basketball courts with brand new full-size backboards and breakaway rims, a fitness circuit area and a gazebo.� In 2018, the new nature play destination playground opened. Public response has been amazing � playground use has increased 400% over 2017, with the highest single day use being Saturday, August 24th at 1,311 kids! The playground has something for everyone�a zip line, play mounds, boulder reading area, velociraptor buried in the sand and more! The Township is most proud that our kids helped build the playground � 623 �kid engineers� selected the playground theme and every play piece! The East Goshen Amphitheater opened in 2014 and has grass tiered seating and plays host to many summer theater productions, movies and concerts like the award winning Liv Live Concert in support of mental health awareness. We encourage those attending Amphitheater events to bring a blanket or folding lawn chairs to comfortably sit and enjoy the various events.\n",
       "The Department of Parks and Recreation filters its strategic and operational goal development through National Recreation and Park Association�s (NRPA) three pillars of health and wellness, social equity and conservation. Most recently, this can be seen with the introduction of our Stones facility. Stones is a ball-toss sport similar to golf and bocce, but played in the woods. It is accessible, can be played by anyone and is devoted to conservation and ecological education. The course safely educates players about native plant species such as the rare Ilex Montana mountain holly. A number of native sedge grasses were found during invasive plant removal, these were propagated offsite and reintroduced in 2017. We look forward to this wonderfully unique, fun and inclusive sport bringing our community together through shared experience.\n",
       "Bicycling, rollerblading and skateboarding are not permitted in the East Goshen Park.�Dogs must be kept on a maximum 6 ft. leash in the park and must be under the control of their owner. Dogs are not allowed at the new playground. Dog urine markings and claw marks compromise the poured in place surface and cause permanent damage. East Goshen Township Park is home to over twenty special events throughout the calendar year and has pavilions available to rent for functions as well. The park closes at dusk and drinking alcohol is prohibited.\n",
       "Applebrook Park is a picturesque passive park which includes three miles of walking/jogging trails leisurely strolling through the park�s rolling hills and expansive views.�Rollerblading and bicycling are permitted in Applebrook Park.� Dogs must be kept on a 6 ft. leash in the park and must be under the control of their owner.� Organized sports activities or group picnics are not permitted in Applebrook Park.� Parking is available at the lot adjacent to the Chester County Chamber of Business and Industry. Collectively, East Goshen and Applebrook Park offer a collective 150 acres of park land connected by over 4.0 miles of trail. In summer months, if you are lucky, you can even spot a Bald Eagle perched above Ridley Creek!\n",
       "The nine-member Park and Recreation Commission advises the department on strategic and operational goals and approves special event permits. Township residents are encouraged to join our �Volunteer Brigade� in support of events, programs and activities. Our department goals are only achieved through a vast network of partners and volunteers and we thank everyone for their continued support.\n",
       "Thank you for learning a little more about the East Goshen Township Department of Parks and Recreation. I hope to see you one day in the park!\n",

EACs have no official powers and function strictly as an advisory resource to our supervisors, Planning Commission, and other township boards, commissions, and committees.\n",
       "Our EAC has been engaged with issues related to: storm water, recycling, composting, native plants, organizing community clean-ups, and hosting educational programs on local farming practices and sustainable agriculture. In addition, the EAC spearheaded the � thus far � successful fight to prevent new gas pipelines from traversing our township.\n",
       "EAC Members\n",
       "Please see the Township Officials for the current members of the Environmental Advisory Council.\n",

       "The EAC welcomes you to attend its meetings, scheduled on the fourth Monday of each month, at 7:00 PM in the Township Building. Work session meetings are held as needed on the third Monday of each month. We encourage and welcome guests and their ideas.\n",

       "In the summer of 2022 East Pikeland held a two-night Compost Workshop for residents. The first 20 households to register and attend received a free vermicomposting system thanks to a zero-waste grant from the Chester County Solid Waste Authority. The goal of the workshop was to educate people about the options they have on their properties and in their homes to reduce their waste. The information shared at the workshop hopefully empowered them to take on composting, reduce their waste, and repurpose yard waste!\n",

       "Native plants are plants that naturally exist in an area without human introduction. They provide food and shelter for native animals and insects that�have evolved alongside them.� These gardens are so important because many insect and bird species can only survive when their host plant is available.� There is an alarming decline in birds that rely on these plants to raise their young. One solution is to provide native plants in every yard because there are no longer areas of native plants in our current environment for these insects and animals to survive. Douglas W. Tallamy's first book, Bringing Nature Home, awakened thousands of readers to an urgent situation: wildlife populations are in decline because the native plants they depend on are fast disappearing.� His solution is to plant more natives. In his book, Tallamy takes the nest step and outlines his vision for grassroots approach to conservation. He explains how homeowners everywhere can turn their yards into conservation corridors that provide wildlife habitats. Pollinator gardens are an example of a tangible action to increase natives in yards.�\n",

       "If you�ve lived in Easttown for even a short time you know that following a heavy rain, we have stormwater issues in our Township. �One method for better managing the increased flow and volume into our creeks following such storm events is through the design and construction of rain gardens. �These gardens are built to receive water from rain gutter downspouts on homes, commercial buildings or from impervious surfaces like a parking lot. �Typically, rain gardens are built with a �bowl-like� shape full of native plants which hold the stormwater, allowing it to enter our waterbodies 24-72 hours after the storm event. �Native plants are specifically utilized in rain gardens as they have longer, more robust root systems than non-native species, while also providing important habitat and food for pollinators. �In collecting and slowly reducing stormwater flow, raingardens also reduce sediment flowing into storm drains; sediment is a major pollutant in southeastern Pennsylvania. Sediment-filled water chokes fish, smothers fish eggs and the insects that fish eat. �The sediments also carry nutrients like phosphates that cause overgrowth of algae in streams, rivers, and the coastal waters into which they flow. �Stormwater and sediment buildup in streams exacerbates flooding of roads and properties which causes property damage and even loss of human life.The Easttown Township EAC has installed its first residential rain garden on Pennsylvania Ave here in Easttown. The rain garden is located along a driveway collecting water from that driveway via a speedbump. The EAC is currently preparing a grant application through the DEP�s Growing Greener Grant program to bring a 3-year formal rain garden program to Easttown Residents. �Please stay tuned for further rain garden program information!\n",

       "PRESS RELEASE�Kennett Township Becomes an Audubon Bird TownKennett Township, March 20, 2019 ��� � � � � � At the March 20, 2019 meeting, the Kennett Township Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution to be recognized as an�Audubon Bird Town. � Leigh Altadonna representing Audubon Pennsylvania was in attendance and presented the Township with official�Audubon Bird Town�street�signs which will be installed on the major roadways that enter the Township. � Kennett Township joins over 20 other municipalities in Pennsylvania that have joined the�Audubon Bird Town program. �This program is a partnership with Audubon Pennsylvania, the state office of the National Audubon Society. � The program recognizes townships for their commitment to stewardship. �The Audubon Bird Town initiative dovetails with the excellent work of the Kennett Township Sustainable Development Office and its Community Based Land Stewardship Program and with on-going programs in Kennett Township run by The Land Conservancy for Southern Chester County (TLC). �Audubon will continue to work with Kennett Township and TLC to highlight the township�s incredible ecological resources and to provide outreach and education to property owners through community events and workshops. � The community can find these events listed on the Townships website:�www.kennett.pa.us.A large part of Kennett Township is already recognized as part of the Audubon Red Clay Creek Valley designated Important Bird Area that is of continental significance. �The Important Bird Area Program is part of an international program that seeks to identify areas of significant protection to birds.The�Audubon Bird Town designation and programs will be directed towards increasing awareness of the uniqueness and value of birds in the Township and to maintaining and improving the habitats that attract birds and butterflies while also providing other benefits such as improved water quality and slowing of storm water runoff.More information on the Audubon Bird Town program or creating a backyard habitat can be found at�http://pa.audubon.org.�Audubon Pennsylvania�s mission is to conserve and restore natural ecosystems, focusing on birds, other wildlife and their habitats for the benefit of humanity and the earth�s biological diversity in Pennsylvania.

       "PRESS RELEASE�Kennett Township Becomes an Audubon Bird TownKennett Township, March 20, 2019 ��� � � � � � At the March 20, 2019 meeting, the Kennett Township Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution to be recognized as an�Audubon Bird Town. � Leigh Altadonna representing Audubon Pennsylvania was in attendance and presented the Township with official�Audubon Bird Town�street�signs which will be installed on the major roadways that enter the Township. � Kennett Township joins over 20 other municipalities in Pennsylvania that have joined the�Audubon Bird Town program. �This program is a partnership with Audubon Pennsylvania, the state office of the National Audubon Society. � The program recognizes townships for their commitment to stewardship. �The Audubon Bird Town initiative dovetails with the excellent work of the Kennett Township Sustainable Development Office and its Community Based Land Stewardship Program and with on-going programs in Kennett Township run by The Land Conservancy for Southern Chester County (TLC). �Audubon will continue to work with Kennett Township and TLC to highlight the township�s incredible ecological resources and to provide outreach and education to property owners through community events and workshops. � The community can find these events listed on the Townships website:�www.kennett.pa.us.A large part of Kennett Township is already recognized as part of the Audubon Red Clay Creek Valley designated Important Bird Area that is of continental significance. �The Important Bird Area Program is part of an international program that seeks to identify areas of significant protection to birds.The�Audubon Bird Town designation and programs will be directed towards increasing awareness of the uniqueness and value of birds in the Township and to maintaining and improving the habitats that attract birds and butterflies while also providing other benefits such as improved water quality and slowing of storm water runoff.More information on the Audubon Bird Town program or creating a backyard habitat can be found at�http://pa.audubon.org.�Audubon Pennsylvania�s mission is to conserve and restore natural ecosystems, focusing on birds, other wildlife and their habitats for the benefit of humanity and the earth�s biological diversity in Pennsylvania.

       "A conservation easement is a legally binding agreement that permanently restricts the use of land for present and future owners. While most frequently used to preserve a property's natural features, conservation easements can also be used to protect farmland, scenic views, historic and archaeologic sites, or recreational lands. View our open space preservation photos.\n",
       "\n",
       "Purpose of Easements \n",
       "Typically, a conservation easement reduces the number of residential lots that might be allowed by zoning ordinances. Easements not only reduce the amount of development that is possible, but they also limit or even prohibit the removal and destruction of woodlands, wetlands, and wildlife habitat areas. Easements might prohibit intensive agricultural uses, such as a feed lot or factory farm. In some cases easements might require the continuation of agriculture uses. Conservation easements have considerable variety, depending on the goals of the landowner and the conservation organization (land trusts, conservancies, and government agencies) that will ensure that the restrictions are honored.\n",
       "\n",
       "Conservation Planning \n",
       "Conservation easements require careful planning and consideration, both by the landowner and by the conservation organization. The process usually begins with an informal conversation between a conservation organization and the landowner regarding their goals and objectives for the land and their financial goals and expectations. The conservation organization will usually follow up with a walking tour of the land, so they can be assured that it will meet their conservation goals. The entire process of placing a conservation easement on a property can take from a few months to a couple of years, depending on the complexity of the conveyance. The conservation organization will guide the landowner through the process and can provide the landowner with description of the steps involved in an easement conveyance.\n",
       "\n",
       "In as much as the conservation easement is a perpetual, and the easement document is recorded in public deed records. The easement will show up on a title report, and it will be binding upon all future owners. Should the original conservation organization cease to exist, the easement will be transferred to another conservation organization by an appropriate court.\n",
       "\n",
       "Internal Revenue Service \n",
       "The Internal Revenue Service recognizes that a conservation easement donated to conservation organization can qualify for a tax deduction as charitable donation. The conservation organization will work with the landowner to make sure the easement meets all of the IRS requirements for a tax deduction. Among other requirements, an easement must accomplish one of the following to qualify for a tax deduction:\n",
       "\n",
       " Preserve land areas for outdoor recreation or for the education of the general public;\n",
       " Protect a significant, relatively natural habitat of fish, wildlife, or plants, or similar ecosystem;\n",
       " Preserve open space pursuant to a clearly delineated governmental conservation policy or for the scenic enjoyment of the general public, and provided the open space will offer a significant public benefit;\n",
       " Preserve a historically important land area or certified structure.\n",
       "\n",
       "This information is intended as educational only and we strongly suggest professional advice be sought before making legal or financial commitments involving land ownership and/or management\n",

       "In December of 2008 the London Grove Township Board of supervisors passed Ordinance 149, establishing an Environmental Advisory Council (EAC) for London Grove Township (LGT). With environmental conservation and improvement as their exclusive focus, EAC�s are designed to have a significant impact on the quality of life in Pennsylvania�s communities. Moreover, EAC�s are an important link between local governing bodies and neighboring communities and often bridge the gap between municipalities forming networks to achieve environmental objectives.\n",

       "How Native Plants Help the Environment\n",
       "Native plants are a natural part of southeastern Pennsylvania�s balanced ecosystem. By gardening with native plants, you maintain this natural cycle of life. Moreover, gardening with native plants helps the environment by reducing pesticide use, conserving water, improving air quality, and encouraging natural biodiversity.\n",
       "Native plants have flourished in southeastern Pennsylvania for thousands of years because they have adapted to our local weather conditions and are more resistant to our pests. This means that, once established, native plants do not need pesticides, fertilizers, or extensive watering to survive. Not only is this good for the environment, it saves time and money.\n",
       "Maintenance\n",
       "Because natives do not need to be maintained like a conventional yard, gardening with them improves the water and air quality. First, pesticides (which, if over used or inappropriately used can kill beneficial insects and other wildlife or cause serious human health problems) can be eliminated or at least minimized since natives can exist without them. Without water run-off carrying pollutants in pesticides and pollutants, water quality is improved. While lawns requires maintenance like mowing and watering, native plants, with their extensive root systems and ability to retain and store water, require little watering, and if left to grow, don�t require mowing.\n",
       "Ecosystem\n",
       "Furthermore, landscaping with native plants, wildflowers, and grasses supports the ecosystem particular to this area. Diverse varieties of bird, butterflies and animals are attracted to plants native to southeastern Pennsylvania and gardening with them helps maintain the biodiversity of our region.\n",
       "Beauty\n",
       "Finally, native plants make beautiful additions to any type of garden.\n",
       "Mt. Cuba\n",
       "One of the most enchanting destinations in Northern Delaware, Mt. Cuba is home to 650 acres of rolling Piedmont hills adorned with native woodland gardens and meadows. Inexpensive tours are led year round. Look out for the Wildflower Celebration held in Spring.\n",
       "Longwood Gardens\n",

       "It is everyone�s responsibility to protect our streams and rivers. �London Grove Township manages storm water by balancing flood/erosion control with water quality. �The Township is responsible for maintaining storm inlets, pipes, and detention basins that are located on Township property or in Township rights of way. �Each property owner is responsible for managing storm water on his/her property.\n",

       "What is Stormwater?\n",
       "When it rains or snows, the water soaks into the ground, evaporates back into the atmosphere or runs off. This runoff, also known as stormwater, has some obvious impacts such as flooding and erosion. Some less obvious, but equally important, impacts of stormwater runoff include increased pollution, reduced ground water supplies, and lower stream flows during dry spells.\n",
       "\n",
       "Traditionally, stormwater has been seen as a nuisance to be collected and dumped into the nearest ditch or stream and disposed of. Unfortunately, such an approach neglects the reality that most of us live or work downstream of someone else. As a result, our neighbor�s nuisance becomes our problem, which in turn becomes a problem for our downstream neighbors.\n",
       "What is Stormwater Management?\n",
       "Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration on flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces.\n",
       "The Township is required to obtain a permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) in order to operate a storm sewer system. The permit, called a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit, requires the Township to take certain steps to ensure that stormwater in the Township is properly managed and controlled. It also requires that the Township educate the public about storm water impacts, as well as provide opportunities for public involvement and participation. To read more about the MS4 program, permits and impacts click on the links below:\n",

       "Stormwater Ordinance\n",
       "Stormwater management in London Grove Township is regulated by Ordinance No. 183 (adopted 04.02.2014) There are different requirements for agricultural and non agricultural projects. For Non-agricultural projects, a stormwater management plan is �required if you intend to create over 1,000 s.f. of impervious surface and/or 5,000 s.f. of earth disturbance. The stormwater management plan must be submitted with the appropriate application and fees for the Township Engineer to review. You should be aware that some projects, generally larger ones, also require the review and approval of the Chester County Conservation District. If you have questions about a specific project or about stormwater management in general, feel free to contact the Township office as well.\n",

       "Report Illicit Discharge\n",
       "Developing and implementing a plan to detect and eliminate illicit discharges to the storm sewer system (includes developing a system map and informing the community about hazards associated with illegal discharges and�improper�disposal�of waste).\n",
       "What is illicit discharge?\n",
       "Federal regulations define an illicit discharge as any discharge to the storm sewer system that is not composed entirely of stormwater. There are exceptions to this rule: firefighting activities, landscape irrigation, foundation drains, waster from crawl space pumps etc. Sources of illicit discharges include: sanitary wastewater, failing septic systems, car wash waste water, improper disposal of household�toxins�or improper use of pesticides and herbicides etc.�Illicit�discharges enter the system wither through direct connections (deliberate pipe hookups to the storm drain system) or indirect connections (spills collected by drain outlets, or deliberate dumping down the storm drain.) These illicit discharges drain directly to the creeks and streams and may be loaded with a large amount of harmful and toxic substances. These pollutants enter the aquatic system and degrade the water quality and threaten wildlife and human health.\n",
       "London Grove Township, as well as many other communities in the Southern Pennsylvania region, recently was required to obtain a permit from the�Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) for its storm drainage system. This permit required the Township to�locate�and map all stormwater piping and drainage ditch systems owned and maintained by the Township. The permit also requires the Township to inspect these�drainage�systems periodically to detect any �illicit discharges� from the systems.\n",
       "What in the world is an illicit discharge? Simply stated, an illicit discharge is something that is exiting a storm drainage pipe or drainage ditch that is not stormwater and potentially could pollute our streams. Examples of illicit�discharges�that would be typical for a community like ours are septic system overflows, sanitary wastewater, chlorinated pool water, paints, oil or other vehicle fluids, etc.\n",
       "While the Township has inspected its drainage�system�thoroughly once since the permit was issued, our inspectors can not be everywhere all the time. If you happen to see something exiting a storm pipe or�ditch�that looks, smells or feels like something other than stormwater, please contact the Township so we can track it to its source and keep our streams as clean and pure as possible. To report an illicit discharge call Ken Battin at the Township, 610-345-0100 or send an email to� kbattin@londongrove.org\n",
       "Please report illicit discharges to the Township: 610-345-0100.\n",
       "Stormwater Tips\n",
       "Auto Care:�Washing your car at home on the driveway or street can send detergents and other contaminants through the storm sewer system. It is best to wash your car at a commercial car wash where the wastewater is treated and recycled. If you do wash your car at home, do so near a grassy area where the water can infiltrate into the ground. And never dump motor oil or antifreeze into the storm drain. Dispose of these at a local service station or approved recycling center.\n",
       "Only Rain in the Drain:�Never dump anything into a storm drain, including oil, paint, soap, debris, and leaves. Storm sewers don�t go to the sewer plant but discharge directly into streams. You might be pouring oil into your own drinking water!\n",
       "Pick Up After Your Dog:�Pet waste can be a major source of excess nutrients and bacteria to our streams. Always properly dispose of pet waste.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Your Car�s Leaking Oil On The Street, Remember It�s Not Just Leaking Oil On The Street:�Leaking oil goes from car to street, and is washed from the street into the storm drain and into our lakes, streams and into coastal waters. Now imagine the number of cars in the area and you can imagine the amount of oil that finds its way from leaky gaskets into our water. So please, fix oil leaks!\n",
       "Residential Landscaping Tips\n",
       "Downspouts:�Direct all downspouts away from pervious surfaces and onto lawns. Rain barrels can be used to collect water from downspouts, making it available for watering.\n",
       "Lawn Care:�Fertilizers and pesticides should be used sparingly. When applied in excess, these chemicals are washed off by rainwater and enter the local storm sewer system. Do not sweep yard waste and leaves into the street. These add extra nutrients to streams.\n",
       "Plant Native Trees and Shrubs:�Erosion of stream banks can be prevented through the use of vegetated strips along the banks. Also known as riparian buffers, these strips of tall grasses, trees and flowers act to stabilize banks, which prevents erosion and additional sediment load in the stream. Click here for a��Native Plant List.�\n",
       "Rain Gardens: A specially designed rain garden can be planted with native vegetation to that will provide an area for rainwater to collect and soak into the ground. Stormwater from rooftop drains and pavement areas can be directed to these vegetated areas. Click here for�Rain Garden instructions.\n",

       "Establishment\n",
       "This Committee was formed in January of 2005 to preserve open space in London Grove Township. The Township believes that the preservation of open space is vital to the community and the standard of living in London Grove Township. It is as much a part of a thriving community�s infrastructure as roads and utilities are.\n",
       "Responsibilities\n",
       "The Committee, along with professional consultants, the public and the Board of Supervisors created a plan to preserve open space. The plan focuses primarily on the purchase or donation of open space and agricultural easements. Acquisition costs are funded by the Open Space Earned Income Tax (OSEIT). This tax is set at 0.25% of income earned. Since the inception of the OSEIT, a total of approximately 400 acres have been preserved via conservation easements.\n",
       "Mission\n",
       "The Open Space Committee�s mission is to identify, develop, and represent the open space interests of London Grove Township.\n",
       "Goal\n",
       "The committee�s goal is to secure the maximum feasible amount of permanently protected open space land within London Grove Township through a variety of public and private mechanisms, in concert with the future plans and policies of the Township and its landowners\n",
       "Objectives\n",
       "The Open Space Committee will pursue its goal through a variety of its own actions and in coordination with other groups and organizations. Its specific objectives include, but are not limited to, the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "Identify and prioritize those open space areas of the Township that warrant protected status for purposes of environmental benefit, natural features protection, and/or agriculture.\n",
       "Recommend and help coordinate additional Township mapping that will facilitate the inventory and analysis of lands targeted for protection\n",
       "Develop a public education and outreach campaign, using newsletter, website, information meetings, individual contacts, etc. for supporting the protection of open space within the Township.\n",
       "Participate, in concert with other London Grove Township committees and groups, in implementing the open space recommendations in the �02 and �05 addenda to the Township Comprehensive Plan, particularly with respect to open space protection measures and greenway corridor protection measures. Maintain close coordination with the Parks and Recreation Board regarding trail and greenway planning and the securing and protection of open space for recreation purposes.\n",
       "Conduct, as part of an overall Township strategy, landowner contacts to secure open space and greenway protection through acquisition, easement donation, and/or landowner agreements/commitments to land management techniques.\n",
       "Develop a plan for public purchase of open space lands or easements within the Township over the next 10 years (i.e., funds needed, sources of funding, etc.)\n",
       "Develop and help initiate specific open space techniques and programs, including:\n",
       "\n",
       "Ongoing Township participation in the County Agricultural Lands Preservation Board�s Challenge Grant program\n",
       "Establishment of a London Grove Township Land Trust\n",
       "Members participate in site walks and site plan reviews with other Township personnel and prospective developers re: proposals for subdivision or land development, to identify open space, resource protection, etc.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Develop conceptual plans for protection and management of potential open space areas and parcels in conjunction with other Township committees and groups and outside agencies, as appropriate.\n",
       "Establish working relationships with groups (e.g. White Clay Wild and Scenic Management Committee, Brandywine Conservancy, Natural Lands Trust, etc.) that have an interest in protecting London Grove�s open space and natural resources from further encroachment by development activities.\n",
       "\n",
       "Maps\n",
       "An important layer of information used by the Township�s Open Space Committee is the Protected Lands Map (PDF). Parcels under permanently protected status represent several categories of private and public action. Most prominent among these are:\n",
       "\n",
       "Agricultural easements sold to the Chester County Agricultural Lands Preservation Board\n",
       "Private conservation easements donated to a land trust such as the Brandywine Conservancy\n",
       "Land in public ownership, including the Township�s Goddard Park and Avon Grove School District properties\n",
       "\n",
       "Taken together, these properties comprise a nucleus of protected lands around which the Open Space Committee can identify additional open space protection initiatives with landowners. Adjacency to protected land is one important criterion in evaluating such lands, as protected open space corridors can yield enhanced resource benefits in terms of habitat, water quality, scenic landscape enhancement, and the like. The combined acreage of the properties shown on the Protected Lands Map is 3,081, or 27% of the total acreage in the Township.\n",

Read the 2014 Chester County Planning Commission Report on��Housing and Transportation Options for Southern Chester County.��More resources for preserving land are found at Chester County Commissioners'� program:��Discover the Future�.New Garden Township's Open Space Review Board, comprised of volunteers, functions to assist landowners with planning to preserve remaining open space for present and future generations to enjoy. To accomplish this, the board members meet with property owners to discuss preservation options, to develop proposals to accomplish the easements necessary to protect the property from eventual development and to recommend satisfactory proposals to the Board of Supervisors for review toward approval. Funding for this activity is generated by a special tax levy of .00125 on earned income, approved by the citizens of the township in 2005.Board members welcome conversations with interested landowners to explore conservation possibilities and use the services of Natural Lands�to facilitate such conservations. Natural Lands�is an organization with much experience and success in protecting open space in eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey since 1953. For more information about Natural Lands, click here to visit their website.Before exploring development of a property, please consider talking with a member of the OSRB (see above) to determine conservation options. Funds are presently available for purchase of conservation easements and, in some situations, may offer comparable value to landowners to outright sale of the property with no easement.An additional task for the board is solicitation of trail easements from property owners to develop the potential trial network described in the New Garden Township Greenways Plan, adopted in 2009. The board works with the�Friends of the New Garden Trails, a volunteer organization of trail aficionados who maintain the trails, provide special programs related to the trails, and provide much of the work required when new trails are established.Board Members (3�year terms) Meet 2nd�Tuesday at 7:00pmVacantJanuary 1, 2026Chris RobinsonJanuary 1, 2026Steven DooleyJanuary 1, 2027Joe MiscioneJanuary 1, 2026Richard MeinzerJanuary 1, 2027Kecia CrowlJanuary 1, 2024Jeremy FisherJanuary 1, 2024Jack Stefferud�, Natural Lands -� OSRB Consultant�� \n",

       "Storm Water Management InformationOctober 6, 2017UncategorizedThe purpose of storm water management is to protect property, infrastructure and streams from destructive storm water impacts by ensuring rain can be absorbed close to where it falls, thereby reducing the volume of run off. By controlling storm water runoff from new impervious and disturbed surfaces on individual properties, we can protect down stream properties, roads and infrastructure from increased flooding and protect water quality in our streams and reservoirs.\n",
       "Without effective storm water management, problems caused by too much run off, erosion and pollutants such as sediment, nutrients and bacteria become very difficult and costly for property owners and communities to fix. Rain Garden\n",
       "Rain Gardens are small vegetated areas for retention and filtration of storm water run off. Compared to a traditional lawn, a rain garden allows approximately 30 % more water to infiltrate into the ground. Rain gardens collect water from roof tops, side walks, and driveways.\n",

       "What is stormwater?Stormwater is rain water and melted snow that runs off streets, lawns, farms, and construction or industrial sites.� Under natural conditions, stormwater is absorbed into the ground, where it is filtered and ultimately replenishes aquifers or slowly flows through forests into streams and rivers.� However, in developed areas, impervious surfaces such as pavement and building roofs prevent precipitation from soaking into the ground.� Instead, the water runs rapidly into storm drains, sewer systems, and drainage ditches.� The rush of stormwater discharge can cause infrastructure damage, downstream flooding, and stream bank erosion.� Also, the bacteria and other pollutants not filtered from stormwater can contaminate streams, rivers, and coastal waters.Things you can do to prevent stormwater runoff pollution:Use fertilizers sparingly and sweep up driveways and sidewalksNever dump anything down storm drains or in streamsVegetate bare spots in the yardCompost your yard wasteDirect downspouts away from paved surfaces; consider a rain gardenTake your car to the car wash instead of washing it in the drivewayCheck your car for various leaks; recycle motor oilHave your septic tank pumped regularlyClean up after your petIt is ILLEGAL to dump grass clippings, pool water, used motor oil, or anything else down storm drains.� They are intended for stormwater only and they drain into streams.Stormwater Management:Penn Township Stormwater Management Ordinanance��Stormwater O&M Agreement��\n",

       "OverviewThe Environmental Advisory Council (EAC) was established to advise the Schuylkill Township Board of Supervisors on the protection, conservation, and management of the use of natural resources like air, water, and land in the Township in a sustainable way. The EAC also provides residents and commercial businesses with information useful in making more informed decisions regarding environmental issues through educational outreach programs and projects. The EAC is composed of eight volunteer residents of Schuylkill Township appointed by the Board of Supervisors.ProjectsIn 2017, the Council completed an inventory of the physical and natural resources of Schuylkill Township (PDF). The maps referenced in the inventory are listed below for viewing or downloading on the Environmental Resource Inventory page.�The Council has also developed educational reference guides for residents on native plants and deer-resistant native plans. This information can be found on the Native & Invasive Plant page.�CodeEstablishment and PurposeArticle XXVIII: Natural Resources Conservation Overlay DistrictSocial MediaFacebook Page\n",

       "OverviewBird Town Pennsylvania works in partnership with local municipalities and like-minded organizations to promote community-based conservation actions to create a healthier, more sustainable environment for birds, wildlife, and people. The program started in 2011, and Schuylkill Township was one of the first participants.Bird Town provides tools for municipalities to engage, educate and empower their residents, schools, and businesses to make more positive social, economic and ecologically friendly decisions. The program also promotes a culture of conservation where everyone is a potential steward of nature in their own backyard and beyond.�Backyard Habitat ProgramsSome residents may be familiar with the backyard habitat certification programs, which encourage individual property owners to improve their backyard habitat. Bird Town supports the actions of these individuals and provides additional tools that foster stewardship for the whole community. Visit the Backyard Habitat Programs webpage for more information on certifying your own backyard.Habitat Issues & Communities Can DoBirds are one of the most visible and measurable indicators of environmental health. Pennsylvania is an important place for year-round and migratory birds. However, habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation continue to negatively impact the population of birds, other wildlife, and plants.Communities can combat the impact of habitat issues by:Encouraging the use of native plants, shrubs, and treesRemoving invasive plantsImplementing storm-water management practicesReducing use of chemicals and pesticidesReducing lawnsCreating a culture of conservationRestoration of natural systems and native plant communities on both private and public lands, positively impacts our communities by creating a healthier environment, reducing storm-water runoff, increasing property values, and building community pride.VolunteerEach year the Schuylkill Township Environmental Advisory Council organizes projects that support our Bird Town status. Please consider volunteering to help with some of these efforts. Property owners seeking more information on Bird Town in Schuylkill Township or businesses interested in sponsoring conservation activities should email Karen Hilyard.�Please visit the Bird Town Pennsylvania website to learn more.Let�s work together to achieve a healthier and sustainable community for all.\n",

       "Stormwater ConcernsLeaves and debris should not be placed in the stormwater drainage area of township streets as clogged catch basins can impede the normal flow of stormwater drainage. Residents can assist in the care of catch basins with the following steps:Do not sweep leaves and other lawn debris into the street as they will eventually wash into the catch basin.Remove fallen leaves and other debris from the street whenever you find them there.Ask neighbors to patrol their areas of the street for leaves.Recycle leaves and limbs at the composting centers.Curbside pickup of leaves is not done by Schuylkill Township. �Residents should contact their waste hauler for yard waste collection dates. �By Township ordinance, haulers should schedule yard waste pickup in the fall. �You may be required to put leaves and debris in recyclable bags which are available, while supplies last, at the township office for 10 cents a bag. �Never rake leaves into or near stormwater drains, ditches, creeks or the river.BurningBurning in Schuylkill Township is prohibited by township ordinance and by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.Composting YardSchuylkill Township maintains a leaf composting yard for the residents of the township. �The compost yard is located in the Valley Forge Sewer Authority complex, at:333 Pawling RoadPhoenixville, PA 19460The compost in the Township�s yard is free to residents.

       "BackgroundPassed in 1972, the Clean Water Act was a response to the nearly unchecked dumping of pollution into our waterways. The Act was expanded in 1987 to require stormwater controls at a local level. �Municipalities in Pennsylvania are required to apply for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit which is administered through the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Details on this program may be found on the PaDEP NPDES website.The program is a 5-year permit and includes six minimum control measures:�Public Outreach and EducationPublic Participation and InvolvementIllicit Discharge Detection and EliminationConstruction Site Stormwater Runoff ControlPost-Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and RedevelopmentPollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and MaintenanceAbout StormwaterStormwater is rainfall that runs off of roofs, driveways, lawns, roads, parking lots, sidewalks, farm fields, and other surfaces created or disturbed by manmade activities. �Stormwater flows over these surfaces which block natural infiltration. �Development greatly increases the runoff volume created during storms which can quickly cause flooding and erosion.Stormwater runoff enters our creeks, rivers, and oceans through storm sewers with no treatment facility buffering the impact of this water. �Whatever the water picks up on its way across the impervious surfaces in the township such as sediment, fertilizers, bacteria, oil and grease, pesticides, trash, etc. goes directly into our local streams, lakes, wetlands and rivers.Educational ResourcesBe Storm Water Smart - An MS4 Educational Brochure (PDF)After the Storm - A Citizen�s Guide to Understanding Stormwater (PDF)Stormwater Management for Small Projects (PDF)Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff (PDF)Neighborhood Stormwater Facilities (PDF)Stormwater ManagementYour roof, yard, driveway, and walkway, as well as sidewalks and streets are all connected to Schuylkill Township�s stormwater management system through storm drains, swales, curbing, and drainage ditches. Most people do not understand that storm drains are the entry point into the storm sewer system, and that stormwater runoff leaving these systems does not get collected and treated like sanitary wastewater. �Inlets connect to pipes which eventually discharge to swales, ditches and streams and finally to the Schuylkill River. Through storm drain marking, Schuylkill Township hopes to increase our residents� awareness about the connection between their yards and the storm sewer system. � The storm drain marker project is one of many activities aimed at preventing dirt, oil, pesticides, fertilizers, trash, pet waste, and household chemicals from entering into our waterways through the Township�s storm sewer system, such as the Pickering Reservoir, an important local drinking water resource.What You Can DoThere are steps that everyone can take to reduce the number of pollutants - trash, debris, pet wastes, and chemicals - carried by stormwater. The most basic way to help is to never dump anything you wouldn�t drink or swim in down a storm drain. Other ways to help include picking up pet wastes, properly disposing of household chemicals such as paints and cleaning supplies, sweeping driveways and sidewalks instead of hosing them, and washing cars at car wash facilities or on lawns rather than in driveways, and keeping inlets and swales clear of debris and leaves. For more information, contact the Township offices. And the next time it rains, consider where the stormwater drains!ResourcesWhen It Rains It Drains Brochure (PDF)Report IssuesEmail stormwater issues or concerns to the Township office or call 610-933-5843.ResourcesHomeownersHomeowners Guide to Stormwater Best Management Protections Maintenance (PDF) - What you need to know to take care of your propertyReducing Runoff - Townships Today Summer 2015Be a Clean Water Partner (PDF)Eco-Friendly Fertilizer for Free (PDF)Hazardous Waste Disposal - Chester County Solid Waste AuthorityChester Ridley Crum Watersheds AssociationIllicit Discharge DetectionCommercialFor the Construction Industry - Stormwater and the Construction IndustryKidsResources for Students and EducatorsWater - Use It Wisely Kids Pagehttp://wateruseitwisely.com/kids/Water Cycle Glossary of TermsTeachersWhat You Can Do: In Your ClassroomBuild Your Own Watershed\n",

       "Tredyffrin Rain Gardens is a program started in 2021 by the Tredyffrin Environmental Advisory Council and the TE Green Team to take action on stormwater and water pollution in our Township. This volunteer-led group has installed an educational rain garden at the Tredyffrin Public Library and launched the residential rain garden program in 2022.\n",
       "Rain gardens are excellent for areas like Tredyffrin, which has seen significant damage from stormwater. Fewer trees, more impervious surfaces and a change in how much and how fast precipitation is falling all contribute to a rather expensive and unhealthy problem. Rain gardens can help by absorbing approximately 30-40% more water than a typical lawn. They also can help recharge the ground water by allowing more stormwater to filter through naturally. They decrease the amount of stormwater running straight off of impervious surfaces into our streams, which decreases the pollutants and salt in our stream water. Since they are planted using all native and deer-resistant plants, they also give local pollinators and wildlife places to thrive. \n",
       "Residents of Tredyffrin can apply to receive a rain garden on their property. Residents will have a co-pay of $100 and will have an obligation to take care of the garden for many years, will have to display a sign, will have to volunteer hours back to the program and more. However, the remaining cost of installing the garden will be covered by a grant the Township received and with volunteer hours. This is neighbors helping neighbors to solve a problem that affects us all.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "*The Fall 2023 Application period is now open.*\n",
       "*Please note that properties must meet certain requirements that include having appropriate soil, slope and public visibility to receive a garden. Applicants who do not receive a rain garden will be encouraged to apply for our next round, encouraged to volunteer so they gain the knowledge to install on their own and will be given educational resources to help them take action on stormwater and pollution.*\n",

       "\n",
       "Composting is the decomposition of plant remains and other once-living materials to make an earthy, dark, crumbly substance that is excellent for adding to houseplants or enriching garden soil. It is the best, most efficient way to recycle your yard and kitchen wastes, and is a critical step in reducing the volume of garbage needlessly sent to landfills for disposal. It's easy to learn how to compost!\n",
       "Composting is not a new idea. In the natural world, this same process occurs as leaves pile up on the forest floor and begin to decay. Eventually, the rotting leaves are returned to the soil, where living roots can finish the recycling process by reclaiming the nutrients from the decomposed leaves. \n",
       "Today, the use of composting to turn organic wastes into a valuable resource is expanding rapidly throughout the United States and in other countries, as landfill space becomes scarce and expensive, and as people become more aware of the impacts they have on the environment. \n",
       "\n",
       "Residents are encouraged to contribute to the \"composting revolution\" by recycling yard and kitchen waste on their own property. Your privately contracted trash hauler will also provide several dates in the Fall which they pick up leaves and yard waste from your property. However, for those who are not able to do so, the Township provides a compost site at 1542 Mill Road, Malvern, PA�for residents of Tredyffrin Township and contractors hired by Tredyffrin residents. This site is open periodically throughout the year.\n",

       "A special permit is required for each property serviced. The permit MUST be signed by the property owner and will only be valid for that specific property. The permit will indicate the number of loads of leaves to be removed from the property. The permit MUST be brought with EACH load to be dumped or you will not be permitted to dump. The Township employee checking the permit will sign and date each load dumped. After the last load allowed by the permit is dumped, the permit will be turned in and kept at the leaf site.

       "The Townships storm drainage system is very important to keeping runoff from flooding roadways and damaging property. The inlets in the streets are interconnected by piping and eventually discharged to a larger pipe, to a stream or ditch. Eventually all of our runoff ends up in the Schuylkill and/or Delaware River.\n",
       "Inlets are spaced along a roadway with most located at low points of the street in order to efficiently collect rainwater. Residents may help themselves by insuring that the opening is free and clear of leaves and other debris prior to a rain storm. If the inlet is clogged and not accepting runoff, the Public Works Department should be called at (610) 408-3620 or email.\n",
       "Streams and drainage ditches/swales are also conveyors of the runoff. Dumping or raking leaves and other garden debris into these channels hurts the environment and seriously impacts drainage down stream.

       "Authorized discharge into the sanitary sewer system: One option residents have to comply with DEP's guidelines is to discharge water into the sanitary sewer system - with Township approval. The Public Works Department will grant approval if the residents follow the DEP Guidelines for waste water disposal, the water conforms to the sewage treatment plant requirements, and there is a public sewer in close proximity to the pool discharge point. The cost for the discharge is $6.51 per thousand (1,000) gallons.\n",

       "The Clean Water Act is the federal legislation that governs stormwater management. Stormwater point discharges to waters of the U.S. are regulated using National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. In 1999, federal regulations extended coverage of the NPDES program to local separate storm sewer systems (MS4�s) serving populations less than 100,000. Upper Uwchlan Township is required to comply with the NPDES program as an MS4. Under the NPDES stormwater program, permittees must develop a stormwater management plan that provides the details of how the community will comply with the requirements of the permit. Permits are based on a framework of six minimum control measures:Public education and outreachPublic participation and involvementIllicit discharge detection and eliminationConstruction site runoff controlPost-construction storm water management in new development and redevelopmentPollution prevention and good housekeeping for municipal operations and maintenance\n",

       "Upper Uwchlan Township's Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)Upper Uwchlan Township is a participant in and is complying with all the requirements of the�Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) program. The goals of the MS4 program and Upper Uwchlan Township are to reduce the discharge of pollutants from the Township, to protect water quality, and to satisfy requirements of the Clean Water Act. Please remember that the water, and any items that go into a storm sewer, goes directly into local streams. This water is not cleaned in any way and does not go to the waste water treatment plant. Residents can assist in keeping our stormwater and stormwater system clean by doing the following: dispose of water properly, clean up after your pets, use fertilizers properly and efficiently to prevent excess runoff, and store potential pollutants indoors. Please monitor stormwater inlets near your property. No one should dump anything into the storm sewer system. If you see someone dumping please call the township at 610-458-9400.Watersheds Located in Upper Uwchlan TownshipBrandywine Creek - East BranchPickering Creek WatershedView Watersheds Map of Chester CountyResourcesFor more information about stormwater management, please see the information displayed on bulletin boards in the township building and other various businesses throughout Eagle Village.\n",

       "Maintenance Tips for HomeownersLawn CareSet lawnmower height to three (3) inches or taller.Maintain thick vegetative cover, which allows for infiltration and reduces erosion.Keep grass clippings on the lawn and out of streets and storm drains.Use grass and leaf clippings, which are high in nutrients, as a �natural fertilizer.�Do not apply fertilizer before spring or within 15-20 feet of a stream or waterway.Leaves and Yard WasteDo not rake or blow leaves into the roadway.Keep leaves out of storm drains and out of our waterways.Leaves in the street end up in storm drains, and drains full of leaves lead to floods. Bag leaves and yard waste in biodegradable bags or open containers and place curbside on designated yard waste days.Snow RemovalShovel first! Deicers are only effective on surfaces where minimal snow has accumulated.�Pile snow downslope on vegetated areas to prevent runoff when snow melts.Minimize use of chemical deicers and salts - Add sand or kitty litter for increased traction.�Limit where you apply deicers to heavily �trafficked areas.\n",

In 1998, the Supervisors acquired sixty acres of land for a new Wallace Community Park.  The acquisition was made possible by grant funding through the Chester County Heritage Park and Open Space Program and the state Keystone Program.  The property borders the west bank of Brandywine Creek and is close to the County's 300 acres Springton  Manor Farm and the 700 acres Marsh Creek State Park.   Recreation programs offered by the Township include an Easter Egg Hunt, Halloween Party, Tree  Lighting Ceremony, and various special events such as�Movie Night�and  Community Day.\n",

The PA DEP, through Act 167, required that all Chester County municipalities adopt the ordinance requirements included �in the Plan. West Caln Township adopted the County's model ordinance, West Caln Township Stormwater Management Ordinance, on April 21, 2014.\n",

There are also a few bird nest boxes placed around the campus to encourage cavity nesters such as bluebirds and tree swallows.  Bird Town Pennsylvania�s mission is to work in partnership with local municipalities and like-minded organizations promoting community-based conservation actions to create a healthier, more sustainable environment for birds, wildlife, and people.  Their goal is to engage all property owners and managers who care about providing good habitat for ecological diversity and a sustainable future. Their vision is to build highways of sustenance and safety to counterbalance the tremendous loss of living space for birds, plants, and all native species.West Vincent EAC and volunteers hope to educate, engage, empower and provide residents with:Native plant informationInvasive plant identification and removal informationBird friendly habitat resourcesLandscaping tipsBird population decline informationBird window strikes actionsBackyard habitat recognition programsBird feeding tipsPesticide alternativesOriginally, part of Audubon PA, Bird Town Pennsylvania has been revived under the guidance of many municipal Bird Town leaders in partnership with local Audubon societies (Valley Forge, Bucks County, Lehigh Valley, and Wyncote Audubon Society, as well as the Pennsylvania Audubon Council).  West Vincent EAC is very excited that this program is active again, as it supports the EAC goal to promote planting native plants for pollinators and biodiversity. Additional resources for attracting and caring for birds can be found on the WV EAC page.

       "\n",
       "To pick up your baby aster, meet us at the Pollinator Pitstop in Evans Park near the Rt. 401 parking area on Wednesday, May 24, 7:30 p.m. - 8:30p.m. (rain date May 25). Please RSVP just to let us know your interest; otherwise, just walk on up and meet us! ��If you love to talk about nature and gardening or if you have any questions, please stay and chat! �If this time is not good for you, email us at eac@westvincenttwp.org to make other arrangements.�\n",
       "\n",
       "The flowers in the Pitstop look so happy! �They bloom all summer long, but pollinators need food in spring and fall, too. �We are gathering on May 24 to add New England Aster and �Solar Cascade� Goldenrod to the Pitstop, extending the bloom time until the end of fall. �Asters and goldenrods bloom until a hard frost. Their purple and yellow flowers look pretty for people and feed those hungry Monarchs as they head south.\n",
       "\n",
       "Both asters and goldenrods are �Keystone Species�. A keystone species is an organism that helps define an entire ecosystem. Without its keystone species, the ecosystem would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether. By planting Keystone plants in our yards, we can have a strong positive effect on the health of our environment. �New England Asters look like small, pretty shrubs during spring and summer. �In fall, they are transformed into mounds of purple flowers. �Goldenrod is usually a large plant that might overwhelm the average garden, but Solar Cascade, the cultivar of Canada Goldenrod that we chose for the pitstop, is a well-behaved garden plant that looks like golden fireworks when blooming in the fall.\n",
       "\n",
       "For more information on our Pollinator Pitstop program, check out our web page. �You will find descriptions of the plants and the planting plan. �\n",

       "In accordance with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection�s (DEP) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit regulations, Willistown Township is required to develop and implement a stormwater management program.The program is based on the federal Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) protocol (developed by DEP).Best Management PracticesThe DEP�s protocols provide our township with suitable guidelines to design a local program that addresses the DEP�s six Best Management Practices (or BMPs), which are also known as control measures.These six BMP�s are designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from MS4s, to the maximum extent practicable, to protect water quality, and to satisfy the appropriate requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act.Best Management Practices CategoriesThe six BMP categories are:Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control MeasureIllicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Control MeasurePollution Prevention and Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and Maintenance Control MeasurePost Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and Redevelopment Control MeasurePublic Education and Outreach Control MeasurePublic Participation and Involvement Control MeasureThe federal regulations provide flexibility within these six categories of BMP�s.Best Management Practices GuidelinesGo to best management practices links for pet owners, business owners, property management, and automobile maintenance.Residents Can Help TooRemember that goes into a storm sewer eventually drains into a stream. Please:Monitor storm sewer inlets near your property. �No one should be dumping anything into the storm sewer system. �Contact the Police Department at 610-647-1440 immediately if you witness illegal dumping.Clean up after your pets and dispose of their waste properly.Use fertilizers properly and efficiently to prevent excess runoff.Properly store materials that could contaminate water supply.Report any chemical spills.Read the Be Stormwater Smart Brochure or watch the short video.Report Violations or ProblemsCitizens are important advocates for the health of our local streams and water systems. To report a concern, see the list of events to report and whom to contact.Additional InformationTownship residents can learn more about these regulations and the need to improve stormwater quality by visiting the DEP website, or reviewing the Chester-Ridley-Crum Watersheds Association website.\n",

       "In some way everybody contributes to polluting our waterways and in nearly every case we can help keep our water clean simply by making a few small adjustments. Understanding more about Stormwater Runoff will help you do your part to help keep our water clean.Stormwater Management for Building ProjectsOn December 13, 2022 the Borough of Phoenixville adopted a new Stormwater Management Ordinance to minimize the impacts of new development, redevelopment and other earth disturbance activities to protect, sustain and enhance the quality and quantity of all water resources to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and preserve the diverse natural resources and aesthetic and recreational assets of Phoenixville Borough, Chester County and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)In addition to the requirements under local zoning and ordinances, federal regulations require individual land development projects to obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for all land development projects that disturb one acre or more. The 1999 update to the federal stormwater regulations also required municipalities throughout Pennsylvania to obtain NPDES permits for their stormwater discharges. Each permit holder must implement and enforce a stormwater management program that reduces the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable.Chester County Water Resources AuthorityChester County�s Water Resources Authority, through Act 167, has created a county-wide integrated water resources management plan that includes the implementation of the local stormwater ordinance (PDF). More information is available on their website.The Chester County Water Resources Authority has prepared a Homeowner and Small Projects Factsheet (PDF) to accompany the following changes. A guide (PDF) created to assist you to develop and implement a stormwater management plan for your property has been created.ApplicationView or download the Stormwater Management Application (PDF).AppendicesView or download the�Stormwater Management Simplified Approach Appendices (PDF).Flood Insurance Rate MapsThe state Department of Community and Economic Development maintains a website containing the new Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The site will help users determine if they are located in a floodplain and assist local officials in their creation of floodplain-management strategies to ensure public safety\n",

       "Phoenixville�s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) ProgramClick here to view the 2022 MS4 videoUntreated and uncontrolled stormwater runoff is the number one cause of impairment in local Pennsylvania waterways. Polluted runoff is often transported through municipal stormwater systems where it is eventually discharged into streams.The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established a municipal stormwater management program known as the MS4 Program that is intended to improve water quality of the waterways in the United States, by reducing the quantities of pollutants that stormwaters can carry into stormsewer systems during storm events.Contact the MS4 ProgramFor additional information concerning the MS4 program or to learn more about volunteer opportunities, please Email MS4 ProgramDischarge PermitAs part of the MS4 Program, the Borough of Phoenixville, like other municipalities, holds a permit to discharge stormwater into the local waterways.As part of this permit, the Borough is responsible for overseeing a stormwater management program that reduces the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent possible, and that satisfies the water quality requirements of the Clean Water Act. In Pennsylvania, the MS4 program is administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).Program ElementsThe MS4 stormwater management program has six elements known as �minimum control measures� (MCM). It is intended that implementation of these six MCMs will result in an immediate and long-term reduction of pollutants that are discharged into waterways. The six minimum control measures include:�Borough Pollution Prevention/Good HousekeepingConstruction Site Runoff ControlIllicit Discharge Detection and EliminationPost Construction Runoff ControlPublic Education and OutreachPublic Participation and InvolvementDo Your PartThe Borough of Phoenixville is committed to improving water quality within the municipal watershed through better management of stormwater runoff. Every resident and business owner needs to participate in the municipal stormwater program by reducing and preventing pollutant runoff from their own property. They should also report any non-stormwater discharges that flow into local waterways to the Borough at 610-933-8801.\n",

       "Rain gardens are an important component of the Borough's DEP-mandated stormwater quality improvement goals, and also help mitigate flooding downstream of their construction by capturing and holding stormwater runoff during heavy precipitation events, and slowing the release of water to flood-prone waterways. Some of the water infiltrates into gravel and soil beneath the garden, and sediment and pollutants settle out or are filtered by hardy plants.You can get involved in the Borough�s rain gardens and keep them looking their best. Volunteers will be involved in plant selection, planting, and light garden maintenance, and most importantly making sure the infrastructure is working as intended.�Participation is contingent on volunteer attendance at an annual training in March, held in conjunction with the Borough's rain garden maintenance provider, and volunteers must sign off on basic rules for participation and a liability waiver. Participation may be capped at 1-2 volunteers per small garden, and 2-3 volunteers for larger gardens.�Sign up as a new or repeat volunteer here!�E-mail the Borough's Sustainability Director with questions at wwilliams@west-chester.com.\n",

In partnership with the Barclay Grounds Preservation Alliance, two trees will be planted and dedicated during the event. A Cornus kousa 'Satomi' tree will be planted to acknowledge the bequest of James Pillagalli in honor of his mother Elizabeth Woolfrey Pillagalli, which paid for over 612 trees planted in West Chester and for our local Veterans group, a Picea orientalis. We hope to see you there!DATE: APRIL 27, 2018TIME: 3:00PMLOCATION: BARCLAY PARK\n",

       "About the Borough's Stormwater SystemIn 2003, West Chester began a comprehensive stormwater management program mandated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and monitored by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). The program is designed to manage stormwater, both by protecting water quality and by preventing high volumes of runoff from causing flooding in developed areas. Any municipality with a population of at least 5,000, including counties, must comply with the program. The Stream Protection Fee Program was implemented in 2017 as a way to comply with this mandate by raising revenue to comprehensively address stormwater management in the borough.Water PollutionWater pollution degrades surface waters making them unsafe for drinking, fishing, swimming, and other activities. As authorized by the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program controls water pollution by regulating point sources that release pollutants into waters of the United States. Point sources can be pipes or man-made ditches that carry stormwater from the street level to the nearest stream.When left uncontrolled, these discharges can result in fish kills, destruction of wildlife habitats, and contamination of drinking water and recreational waterways. Sediment from yard debris and construction sites can cause stream bank erosion, vegetation destruction, and flooding. It is therefore extremely important to recognize that individual actions can multiply the effect on water quality.Factors to PollutionConcentrated development in urbanized areas substantially increases impervious surfaces, such as streets, driveways and parking lots. These surfaces are the primary collector of pollutants until a rain washes them into nearby storm drains. Common pollutants include pesticides, fertilizers, oils, salt, litter, and sediment. Storm drains do not run to treatment plants. They empty directly into waterways.Protecting Water QualityBecause West Chester owns the stormwater conveyance system within the municipal boundaries, the responsibility lies with the borough to ensure that any water pollution entering the system is minimized to the fullest extent possible. The borough strives to protect water quality through:Education of residents, businesses, developers, and its own staffUse of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce the discharge of pollutants into streamsFor instance, a large component of the program is the requirement that the borough screens its stormwater outfalls for potential conditions of pollution and takes corrective action in the event a pollutant source is found.Citizen Participation & AwarenessAnother major component of the program requires an effort by the borough to increase citizen participation and awareness. It is important for West Chester's residents and businesses to be aware that increased stormwater runoff and pollution can occur from many different sources, and can cause a number of different problems.\n",

The Township follows DEP protocols which provide our township with suitable guidelines to design a local \n          program that address the DEP’s six Best Management Practices (BMPs), which are also known as “control measures.”\nThe six BMPs are designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from MS4s, to the maximum extent practicable, \n          to protect water quality, and to satisfy the appropriate requirements of the federal Clean Water Act. These six \n          BMP categories are:\n\nPublic Education & Outreach Control Measure\nPublic Participation & Involvement Control Measure\nIllicit Discharge Detection & Elimination Control Measure \nConstruction Site Stormwater Runoff Control Measure \nPost Construction Stormwater Management in New Development & Redevelopment Control Measure \nPollution Prevention and Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and Maintenance Control Measure.\n\nIf anyone is seeking information or has issues regarding stormwater, please contact either:\n\n\n            Christopher W. Heleniak, Township Manager, (610) 240-0326\n\n            Daniel T. Wright, P.E., Township Engineer, 610) 840-9100\n\nPlease visit the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Stormwater Management Program Website\n          www.dep.state.pa.us, go to directLINK “stormwater” for \n          additional details and technical information on this topic at the state level.\n\nAct 167\n\nIn response to the impacts of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from land development,\n          in 1978, the state enacted Pennsylvania’s Stormwater Management Act (Act 167). The Act requires counties\n          to prepare and adopt watershed based stormwater management plans—and requires municipalities to adopt\n          and implement ordinances to regulate development consistent with these plans. The DEP provides technical,\n          administrative and financial assistance to counties in preparing Stormwater Management Plans and pays\n          for 75% of the costs counties incur in preparing plans. DEP also approves reimbursements to municipalities\n          for 75% of the allowable costs of preparing plans and for enacting, administering, and implementing\n          stormwater ordinances.\n\nKeeping Pool Water from Damaging Streams\n\nAs part of regular pool maintenance, residents and pool managers need to be aware of\n          ways to minimize the hazardous impact pool water, which contains chemicals, has on the environment.\n\nLeave water in pool for at least one week, without chlorinating, prior to draining.\nDrain pool only when test kit indicates no detectable chlorine levels and a pH level of 6.5 – 7.8.\nIf your pool contains algae or a black film of organic matter, collect and flush it down the toilet.\nPump pool water slowly out over a grassy area, so it can soak in. Avoid drainage paths that may spill\n            water onto a neighbor’s property.\nNever drain pool water directly into a stream, pond, storm drain, or other body of water.\nProperly store pool chemicals to prevent leaks or spills. In addition, follow the instruction label\n            for proper disposal.\n\nBy following these simple steps, you help ensure that your pool will not only provide\n          months of summer fun, but also reduce the number of pollutants it could add to our precious natural\n          water supplies.\nAny questions, please contact your municipality.\n\nStormwater Education\nUseful materials on stormwater. They are also available upon request from the Township Office.\n\n\nTownships Today - Fall \n            2013 – Reducing Runoff Issue\nHomeowners Guide to\n            Stormwater BMP Maintenance (Rev.

As the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces such as paved streets, parking lots, and building rooftops it accumulates debris, chemicals, sediment or other pollutants that can adversely affect water quality. The primary method to control stormwater discharges is the use of best management practices (BMPs). \n\nWhy is Stormwater Management Important?\n\nUnlike water that enters our municipal sewage system, stormwater is not cleaned and treated at a wastewater plant before it re-enters our streams and waterways. Stormwater runoff from roads and other impervious areas comes into contact with pollutants and allows those pollutants into our waters. It is essential that municipalities put in place a focused Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) to combat polluted stormwater runoff.\n\nPolluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s), from which it is often discharged untreated into local waterbodies. To help to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped into an MS4, operators must obtain a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit through the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and develop a stormwater management program.\n\nMS4...� What�s�That?\n\nA Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) is any municipal-owned stormwater conveyance or system of conveyances. i.e. Township roads, ditches/swales, and stormwater pipes.� East Brandywine Township has to comply with the NPDES MS4 permit through 6 Minimum Control Measures (MCMs):\n\nMCM #1�Public Education & Outreach - East Brandywine Township has made efforts to educate the public about the Stormwater Management Program through several methods, including: the Township website, the Township newsletter, Mile Marker, and the partnership with the Brandywine Valley Association (BVA).\n\nMCM #2�Public Involvement/Participation - East Brandywine Township encourages the public to participate in the stormwater management program decision-making process and routinely communicates with the BVA. The Township�s MS4 Annual Reports are available to the public for review by request. \n\nMCM #3�Illicit Discharge Detection & Elimination - East Brandywine Township maps all of its stormwater features, including: outfalls, surface waters, roads, inlets, pipes, basins, etc. Illicit discharges to the MS4 are prohibited in East Brandywine Township. Outfalls are inspected regularly to verify that there are no illicit discharges and to take the appropriate actions if an illicit discharge is discovered. Examples of illicit discharges include: substances (such as used motor oil, etc.) that have been dumped into a storm sewer or waterbody, wastewater piped directly from a home to the storm sewer, failing septic systems, etc. \n\nMCM #4�Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control - East Brandywine Township and the Chester County Conservation District (CCCD) ensure that construction sites have adequate Erosion and Sedimentation (E&S) Control Best Management Practices (BMPs) and maintain them throughout the duration of the project to prevent accelerated erosion and sedimentation to the MS4.\n\nMCM #5�Post Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and Re-Development - East Brandywine Township and the CCCD ensure adequate Post Construction Stormwater Management (PCSM) BMPs are proposed and installed properly. Once construction of these BMPs is complete, East Brandywine Township regularly inspects the PCSM facilities to ensure that they are functioning properly. \n\nMCM #6�Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping � East Brandywine Township has identified all Township-owned facilities and activities (fleet vehicle maintenance, winter de-icing, etc.) that have a potential to impact stormwater and developed an Operations and Maintenance Program to prevent stormwater pollution. Township employees are regularly trained in all aspects of the Stormwater Management Program.\n\nWhat is East Brandywine Township Required to Do?\n\nThe stormwater requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) are administered under the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and implemented by DEP through the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) Program. Almost all municipalities (including East Brandywine) in Pennsylvania must have an MS4 permit.\n\nEast Brandywine Township must comply with its MS4 permit through a robust stormwater management program. For more information on the MS4 program go to DEP�s MS4 Resource Page. In order to improve stream and waterway quality, federal regulations establishes Minimum Control Measures (MCMs) that must be implemented through the MS4 program. \n\nThe six regulations are:\n\n\n Public Education and Outreach\nPublic Participation and Involvement\nIllicit Discharge Detection and Elimination\nConstruction Site Runoff Control\nPost-Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and Redevelopment\nPollution Prevention and Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and Maintenance\n\nMunicipalities meet these MCM requirements through a series of Best Management Practices (BMPs) which are schedules of activities, prohibition of practices, structural controls, design criteria, maintenance procedures, and other management practices that reduce pollution to the waters of the Commonwealth.\n\nFor more information on MCMs and BMPs please go to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) MS4 Page where Minimum Control Measures along with the respective Best Management Practices are listed and explained.\n\nHow Can You Help?\n\nStart by creating stormwater-friendly lawns and gardens! When the amount of rain falling exceeds the land�s ability to absorb it, the result is stormwater runoff. Without treatment, stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment. Runoff can carry chemicals, metals, bacteria, viruses, organic compounds, and other pollutants directly into creeks, lakes, rivers, and streams. Runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding � even during a typical Pennsylvania storm.\n\nClearly, then, what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water. That means everyone, not just government, plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries. This summer, homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens and lawns are �stormwater-friendly.� \n\nThere are many ways you can protect water quality by preventing stormwater pollution including:\n\n\n Never dump anything in storm drains, streams, wetlands, or lakes.\nClean up pet waste.\nReduce the use of herbicide, pesticide and fertilizer.\nRe-vegetate bare spots in your yard to reduce erosion.\nReport illicit discharges to East Brandywine Township.\nHave your septic tank pumped and inspected regularly.\nCheck your car for leaks and recycle your motor oil.\n Properly dispose of yard waste.\n\nThe Stormwater-Friendly Garden\n \nHome gardens can contribute considerable nutrients and other pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly. This mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticides.\n\nFertilizers: Instead of using chemical fertilizers, give organic alternatives, such as compost and manure, a try. Compost, a �do-it-yourself� fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings, contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow. When using organic fertilizers, be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoff.\n\nPesticides: Many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem. If one is posing a problem, however, identify the exact pest you have and research the non-chemical alternatives to controlling it. Pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater, possibly contaminate drinking supplies, and hurt downstream ecosystems.\n\nThe Stormwater-Friendly Lawn\n\nThe following lawn-care steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners:\n\n\n Set your mower height to 3 inches or higher. Taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system, which absorbs more water and prevents erosion. Deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them.\n Keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property. A mulch-mower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn. The clippings decompose quickly, provide important nutrients for your lawn, and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration. Using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers. If mulching with your clippings is not possible, bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material that�s created as a fertilizer later.\n Figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn. Foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems. However, if your lawn is thin or has bare spots, you may not have a choice since a dense, vegetated cover is the most stormwater-friendly lawn. There are no one-size-fits-all guidelines when it comes to fertilizer. Homeowners� needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and pH and nutrient levels. In fact, soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from �micronutrient deficiency,� a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate. Identifying your lawn�s needs first will reduce unnecessary applications, create a healthier lawn faster, and reduce your long-term costs.\n If fertilizer is needed, maximize the benefits of slow-release nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications. Typically called �water insoluble nitrogen,� or WIN, on fertilizer bags, slow-release nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation. This type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring, instead of the fall, to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season. Another tip: Homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in March to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after October. Fertilizing during a lawn�s dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active.\n Do not fertilize or use pesticides within 15 to 20 feet of a stream. Keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways. Also, if you live near a stream, consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead. To learn more about these buffers, visit www.stormwater.allianceforthebay.org and click on �Structural BMPs.� Also, when you�re done applying fertilizer, immediately sweep any granulated chemicals off hard surfaces and back onto your lawn. Your walkway, driveway, patio, or local road is often a quick route to the drainage pipes that discharge into local streams.\n\nIn the long run, little actions, such as taking a stormwater-friendly approach to your garden and lawn, will have a big impact as all of them work together to protect our water�s quality.\n\nWhat is a watershed?\n\nA watershed is the area of land that captures rain and snow, then stores, filters, seeps, or drains this water into a common waterbody (marsh, stream, river or lake). A watershed includes the network of streams that drains that surface land area and the groundwater and aquifers located underground that contribute water to those streams.\n\nEast Brandywine Township has three main subwatersheds: Beaver Creek, Culbertson Run, and East Branch Brandywine Creek. Both Beaver Creek and Culbertson Run drain into East Branch Brandywine Creek. East Branch Brandywine flows into Brandywine Creek, which is part of the larger Christina River Basin, and ultimately the Delaware Bay. \n\nLinks\n\n\n Chester County Water Resources Authority � Stormwater Management\n Chester County Water Resources Authority � Christina Basin TMDL & Implementation Plan\n Chester County Conservation District\n DEP - Municipal Stormwater\n EPA - Municipal Stormwater\n EPA - MS4 Fact Sheets\n Brandywine Valley Association (BVA) Homepage\n Pennsylvania Environmental Council � Water Resources Information\nWater Resources Education Network (WREN) � Stormwater Information\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nStormwater Management\n\n\nSnow Removal\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1214 Horseshoe Pike\n|\nDowningtown, PA 19335\n|\nPh: 610-269-8230\nAdministration Offices Open Monday through Friday��9:00 AM to 5:00 PM�\nHome\n|\nContact Us\n|\nAccessibility\n|\nSite Map\n|\nCopyright Notices\n|\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Left\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\nSlideshow Left Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\nSlideshow Right Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It also works with the Board of Supervisors and township administration to develop procedures to maintain and acquire open space.\nIn November 2002, East Brandywine voters, by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, approved a referendum to increase the Earned Income Tax by one-eighth of 1% to finance the preservation of open space within the township. Based on this dedicated funding source, the township supervisors floated a bond issue in 2003 that included $3 million dedicated for open space preservation expenditures.\nIn 2004, after months of negotiation, the first payoff from the voter-approved plan to preserve open space became a reality. Using grants from the Chester County Preservation Partnership program totaling approximately half of the purchase price and Open Space Funds, the township purchased the conservation easement on 39 acres of fields and woods fronting Dowlin Forge and Rock Raymond Roads. As part of the deal, the township also purchased a nearby two-acre lot on Dowlin Forge Road for future trail access and a small park.� Since then, the Township has acquired 7 more property easements and 2 additional fee simple properties. The total land preserved through the Open Space Program is over 200 acres.� State and county grants have covered almost half of the cost of preserving this land.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent ActivitiesBecause of the sensitivity of its discussions with landowners, most of the Open Space Committee's deliberations take place in executive session. As a result, there has been little publicity about its work. �The committee is always interested in considering proposals from residents who wish to preserve their land. �Please contact Township Staff at (610) 269-8230 so they may direct your inquiry to the Committee.Open Space Committee representatives also attend township Planning Commission meetings to provide feedback on new development proposals, and encourage adoption of open space-friendly ordinances that allow development to the same density, but promote more creative use of a property to preserve open space elements such as the view shed. �In 2010 the Growing Greener Ordinance was passed. �It was based on the Natural Lands Trust Growing Greener Model Ordinance.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nProtected Lands Map\n\n \nClick to Download PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nBondsville Mill Park Committee\n\n\nHistorical Commission\n\n\nMunicipal (Sewer) Authority\n\n\nOpen Space Committee\n\n\nParks & Recreation Board\n\n\nPlanning Commission\n\n\nTrails Committee\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommittee Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChester County Open Space Program\n\n\n\nChester County Landscapes 2 Program\n\n\n\nBrandywine Conservancy Environmental Management Center\n\n\n\nNatural Lands Trust\n\n\n\nTrust for Public Land\n\n\n\nHeritage Conservancy\n\n\n\nSustainable Communities Network\n\n\n\nLincoln Institute of Land Policy\n\n\n\nCenter of Excellence for Sustainable Development\n\n\n\nPA Environmental Council\n\n\n\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChair�Alan YefkoVice-Chair�VacantSecretary�Louise WalkerJay FischerEdward HustonMark Smith\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1214 Horseshoe Pike\n|\nDowningtown, PA 19335\n|\nPh: 610-269-8230\nAdministration Offices Open Monday through Friday��9:00 AM to 5:00 PM�\nHome\n|\nContact Us\n|\nAccessibility\n|\nSite Map\n|\nCopyright Notices\n|\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Left\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\nSlideshow Left Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\nSlideshow Right Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The volunteers of this committee also host events and fund-raisers for park improvements. �A fourth park, Bondsville Mill Park, opened to the public in 2015 and its development is being overseen by a separate committee.Opportunities for active recreation, in the form of youth leagues for team sports, are created and managed by the East Brandywine Youth Association (EBYA) an independent non-profit organization that enjoys priority access to, and shares in the maintenance of, the Township's athletic fields.East Brandywine is one of eight municipal members that, along with the Downingtown Area School District, comprise the Downingtown Area Recreation�Consortium (DARC). DARC is a regional municipal recreation organization thatoffers recreation, adult education, and youth learning opportunities. The Township contributes financially to the administrative and program costs; user fees also are charged to cover operating costs of DARC's various programs.HistoryThe East Brandywine Parks and Recreation board was created in 1990.�The Brown family, who owned a farm on Dilworth Road, approached the Township and asked if the community would like to buy some of the land,� recalls Jimm Worrell, a founding member of the Board. �The Township agreed to buy 10 acres.� The agreement said that it could later buy more. �This was the beginning of today�s Community Park, which extended to today�s 60-plus acres in two further steps.At the time, the Township already owned two parks:�Spatola Park on Raleigh Drive,�and Hopewell Field on Township Road. With the addition�of a third park, the Township�decided it needed a separate�body to oversee all three, and�so the Park & Recreation Board came�into being with an initial eight�members.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nYouth Athletics\n\n\nBondsville Mill Park\n\n\nDowningtown Area Recreation Consortium (DARC)\n\n\nGolf Outing Registration\n\n\nReserve a Park Facility\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChairmanSandy LammeyVice-Chairman�David SummersSecretaryVacantMemberGail MatthewsMemberVacantMemberVacantMemberVacant\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1214 Horseshoe Pike\n|\nDowningtown, PA 19335\n|\nPh: 610-269-8230\nAdministration Offices Open Monday through Friday��9:00 AM to 5:00 PM�\nHome\n|\nContact Us\n|\nAccessibility\n|\nSite Map\n|\nCopyright Notices\n|\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Left\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\nSlideshow Left Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\nSlideshow Right Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This position has been filled admirably since 2015 and we look forward to meeting our next Poet Laureate! Open to all ages, but must be a Township resident. Contact Jason at jlang@eastgoshen.org with any questions. The application is available at https://forms.gle/4H4Nqh54VenapKzr7 and open until January 15th, 2023. **\n�\nRead the Parks and Recreation 2022 Year End Report\nRead the Past P&R Year End Reports\nPaoli Pike Trail Use, Guidelines and Etiquette\nFrom Survive to Thrive: Why Parks and Recreation are Important\nEast HS Environmental Club presentation � Ways to help our Community\n�\nThe East Goshen Township Department of Parks and Recreation manages over 500 acres of park space, is a steward for conservation efforts and offers programs, activities and events that increase the quality of life for Township residents. Simply put, it is �In the Business of Making Memories�.�� The department has experienced tremendous growth and success in recent years, increasing programmatic hours by over 500% since 2014. To meet current and future resident needs, the department has identified walkability as a chief strategic goal. We�re proud to have received over $3.6M in grant funding to support the construction of the upcoming Paoli Pike Trail project. It will connect the many land uses lining Paoli Pike, allowing park users to safely navigate Township facilities, offer students a safe route to school, and support our local community businesses. Park land is anchored by East Goshen Township Park, a 55-acre active park made lovely by rolling hills with vistas crossing over to its sister passive park, Applebrook Park, a 98 �acre passive park framed by Ridley Creek. East Goshen Township Park has a full complement of recreational facilities: baseball, softball and soccer fields; a multi-use field, a sand volleyball court, three tennis courts and two pickleball courts; two full-size basketball courts with brand new full-size backboards and breakaway rims, a fitness circuit area and a gazebo.� In 2018, the new nature play destination playground opened. Public response has been amazing � playground use has increased 400% over 2017, with the highest single day use being Saturday, August 24th at 1,311 kids! The playground has something for everyone�a zip line, play mounds, boulder reading area, velociraptor buried in the sand and more! The Township is most proud that our kids helped build the playground � 623 �kid engineers� selected the playground theme and every play piece! The East Goshen Amphitheater opened in 2014 and has grass tiered seating and plays host to many summer theater productions, movies and concerts like the award winning Liv Live Concert in support of mental health awareness. We encourage those attending Amphitheater events to bring a blanket or folding lawn chairs to comfortably sit and enjoy the various events.\nThe Department of Parks and Recreation filters its strategic and operational goal development through National Recreation and Park Association�s (NRPA) three pillars of health and wellness, social equity and conservation. Most recently, this can be seen with the introduction of our Stones facility. Stones is a ball-toss sport similar to golf and bocce, but played in the woods. It is accessible, can be played by anyone and is devoted to conservation and ecological education. The course safely educates players about native plant species such as the rare Ilex Montana mountain holly. A number of native sedge grasses were found during invasive plant removal, these were propagated offsite and reintroduced in 2017. We look forward to this wonderfully unique, fun and inclusive sport bringing our community together through shared experience.\nBicycling, rollerblading and skateboarding are not permitted in the East Goshen Park.�Dogs must be kept on a maximum 6 ft. leash in the park and must be under the control of their owner. Dogs are not allowed at the new playground. Dog urine markings and claw marks compromise the poured in place surface and cause permanent damage. East Goshen Township Park is home to over twenty special events throughout the calendar year and has pavilions available to rent for functions as well. The park closes at dusk and drinking alcohol is prohibited.\nApplebrook Park is a picturesque passive park which includes three miles of walking/jogging trails leisurely strolling through the park�s rolling hills and expansive views.�Rollerblading and bicycling are permitted in Applebrook Park.� Dogs must be kept on a 6 ft. leash in the park and must be under the control of their owner.� Organized sports activities or group picnics are not permitted in Applebrook Park.� Parking is available at the lot adjacent to the Chester County Chamber of Business and Industry. Collectively, East Goshen and Applebrook Park offer a collective 150 acres of park land connected by over 4.0 miles of trail. In summer months, if you are lucky, you can even spot a Bald Eagle perched above Ridley Creek!\nThe nine-member Park and Recreation Commission advises the department on strategic and operational goals and approves special event permits. Township residents are encouraged to join our �Volunteer Brigade� in support of events, programs and activities. Our department goals are only achieved through a vast network of partners and volunteers and we thank everyone for their continued support.\nThank you for learning a little more about the East Goshen Township Department of Parks and Recreation. I hope to see you one day in the park!\n~Jason Lang, MS, CPRE\nDirector of Parks and Recreation\nEast Goshen Township\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Vision: Endeavor to be one of the premier communities in Chester County by continually improving the quality of life while, at the same time, managing growth and development in a manner consistent with the protection of our environment and preservation of our natural and historic resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n� 2023 Copyright East Goshen Township.\nTerms and Conditions | Privacy Policy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t | Contact\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDesigned &Maintained byw3 Nerds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Its function is to offer guidance on environmental improvement and conservation. Since members are township residents, they are better equipped than a county or state agency to know about our environmental resources and concerns. EACs have no official powers and function strictly as an advisory resource to our supervisors, Planning Commission, and other township boards, commissions, and committees.\nOur EAC has been engaged with issues related to: storm water, recycling, composting, native plants, organizing community clean-ups, and hosting educational programs on local farming practices and sustainable agriculture. In addition, the EAC spearheaded the � thus far � successful fight to prevent new gas pipelines from traversing our township.\nEAC Members\nPlease see the Township Officials for the current members of the Environmental Advisory Council.\nMeetings\nThe EAC welcomes you to attend its meetings, scheduled on the fourth Monday of each month, at 7:00 PM in the Township Building. Work session meetings are held as needed on the third Monday of each month. We encourage and welcome guests and their ideas.\nNews and Events\nRepair Cafe: September 9,�2023Lecture & WalkElectronics Recycling, June 27,�2023Audubon Plant Giveaway, Spring�2023Township Roadside Cleanup: April 1,�2023\nRecycling and Upcycling resources.\nMore posts regarding the EAC.\nTo receive our email announcements covering speaker series events and other opportunities to volunteer in the community (e.g. township clean-up day), please send your email contact information to EastNantmealEAC@gmail.com.

The first 20 households to register and attend received a free vermicomposting system thanks to a zero-waste grant from the Chester County Solid Waste Authority. The goal of the workshop was to educate people about the options they have on their properties and in their homes to reduce their waste. The information shared at the workshop hopefully empowered them to take on composting, reduce their waste, and repurpose yard waste!\n�\nLinks to the video from the workshops are below as well as handouts and powerpoints from each session.\n�\nCompost Workshop Night 1: Outdoor Composting\n�\nCompost Workshop Night 2: Indoor Composting\n�\n�\n���\nGuides:\n�\n�Home Composting: A guide for Home�Gardeners\n�\nComposting and vermicomposting\n�\nComposting Leaves\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Environmental Topics:\n\n\nNative Plants\n\n\nCompost\n\n\nReady for 100 / Clean Energy Transition Plan\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n | Boards & Personnel\n | Community Events\n | Calendar of Events\n | Community Information\n | Emergency Preparedness\n | Environmental Topics\n | Fall & Winter Information\n | FAQ's\n | History of East Pikeland\n | Newsletters & Guides\n | Open Space\n | Ordinances & Plans\n | Parks & Trails\n | Permits and Forms\n | Police Department\n | Public Notices\n | Request for Information\n | Stormwater Program\n | Spotted Lanternfly\n | Subdivision / Land Development\n | Trash & Recycling\n | Zoom Meetings\n\n\nGovernment Websites by Catalis\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPrinter-friendly Version\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They provide food and shelter for native animals and insects that�have evolved alongside them.� These gardens are so important because many insect and bird species can only survive when their host plant is available.� There is an alarming decline in birds that rely on these plants to raise their young. One solution is to provide native plants in every yard because there are no longer areas of native plants in our current environment for these insects and animals to survive. Douglas W. Tallamy's first book, Bringing Nature Home, awakened thousands of readers to an urgent situation: wildlife populations are in decline because the native plants they depend on are fast disappearing.� His solution is to plant more natives. In his book, Tallamy takes the nest step and outlines his vision for grassroots approach to conservation. He explains how homeowners everywhere can turn their yards into conservation corridors that provide wildlife habitats. Pollinator gardens are an example of a tangible action to increase natives in yards.�\n�\nThe Garden Plan was designed by Nicole Keegan.�\n�\n�\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks\nNature's Best Hope by Doug Tallamy�\nBringing Nature Home by Doug Tallamy�\nThe Nature of Oaks by Doug Tallamy\nNoah's Garden by Sara Stein�\n\n\nWebsites\nwww.homegrownnationalpark.org�\nwww.wildones.org\nwww.nwf.org\nwww.dcnr.pa.gov/Conservation/WildPlants�\nwww.xerces.org/pollinator-conservation��\nwww.wildflower.org/plants-main\n\n\nLocal Native Plant Suppliers\nKimberton Whole Foods Garden\nGreen Ridge Gardens�\nRedbud Native Plant Nursery�\nNorthbrook Native Plant Nursery�\n\n\nSample Native Gardens\nNorthbrook Native Plant Nursery�\nWest Vincent Pollinator Garden�\nPrairie Nursery�\n\n\n\n\n\n�\nTownship Park Plant List�Pictures to come...\n�\nPrairie DropseedSporobolus heterolepsisPrairie Dropseed adds a touch of elegance to any planting.

Sediment-filled water chokes fish, smothers fish eggs and the insects that fish eat. �The sediments also carry nutrients like phosphates that cause overgrowth of algae in streams, rivers, and the coastal waters into which they flow. �Stormwater and sediment buildup in streams exacerbates flooding of roads and properties which causes property damage and even loss of human life.The Easttown Township EAC has installed its first residential rain garden on Pennsylvania Ave here in Easttown. The rain garden is located along a driveway collecting water from that driveway via a speedbump. The EAC is currently preparing a grant application through the DEP�s Growing Greener Grant program to bring a 3-year formal rain garden program to Easttown Residents. �Please stay tuned for further rain garden program information!\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nResidential Rain Garden in Easttown\n   \n \n \n\n\n\nPhotos by Amedeo Piccioni\n   \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-Use Plastic Carry-Out Bag Ordinance\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinance No. 451-22\n\n\n\n\nLocal Vendors of Compliant Bags\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Notice\n\n\n\n\nPoint-of-Sale Sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompost Swap\n\n\n\n\nROSERP (Recreation, Open Space, and Environmental Resources Plan)\n\n\n\n\nSeed Library\n\n\n\n\nTrex Recycling Program\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events, Programs and Workshops\n\n\n\n\nEAC Newsletters and Reports\n\n\n\n\nStreet Tree Planting Program\n\n\n\n\nRain Garden Program\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermit Information & FormsAccess building, zoning, and miscellaneous forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermit PortalSubmit permits, make a payment, or check the status of your permit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitizens' ReporterReport an issue or concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapLinkView our interactive Zoning Map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgendas/MinutesStay connected and engaged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice DepartmentStay aware and informed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTownship CodeView the Township Code online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen RecordsSubmit a Right-to-Know Request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n566 Beaumont Road\n\n\nDevon, PA 19333\n\n\nHours: 8 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday - Friday\n\n\nPhone: 610-687-3000\n\n\nFax: 610-687-9666\n\n\nEmail the Township\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice Department\n\n\n\nTownship Code\n\n\n\nOpen Records\n\n\n\nDocument Center\n\n\n\nZoning Ordinance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Info\n\n\n\nOnline Payments\n\n\n\nTownship Directory\n\n\n\nPermits & Inspections\n\n\n\nTrash & Recycling\n\n\n\nAgendas & Minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright Notices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Left\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\nSlideshow Left Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\nSlideshow Right Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While most frequently used to preserve a property's natural features, conservation easements can also be used to protect farmland, scenic views, historic and archaeologic sites, or recreational lands. View our open space preservation photos.\n\nPurpose of Easements \nTypically, a conservation easement reduces the number of residential lots that might be allowed by zoning ordinances. Easements not only reduce the amount of development that is possible, but they also limit or even prohibit the removal and destruction of woodlands, wetlands, and wildlife habitat areas. Easements might prohibit intensive agricultural uses, such as a feed lot or factory farm. In some cases easements might require the continuation of agriculture uses. Conservation easements have considerable variety, depending on the goals of the landowner and the conservation organization (land trusts, conservancies, and government agencies) that will ensure that the restrictions are honored.\n\nConservation Planning \nConservation easements require careful planning and consideration, both by the landowner and by the conservation organization. The process usually begins with an informal conversation between a conservation organization and the landowner regarding their goals and objectives for the land and their financial goals and expectations. The conservation organization will usually follow up with a walking tour of the land, so they can be assured that it will meet their conservation goals. The entire process of placing a conservation easement on a property can take from a few months to a couple of years, depending on the complexity of the conveyance. The conservation organization will guide the landowner through the process and can provide the landowner with description of the steps involved in an easement conveyance.\n\nIn as much as the conservation easement is a perpetual, and the easement document is recorded in public deed records. The easement will show up on a title report, and it will be binding upon all future owners. Should the original conservation organization cease to exist, the easement will be transferred to another conservation organization by an appropriate court.\n\nInternal Revenue Service \nThe Internal Revenue Service recognizes that a conservation easement donated to conservation organization can qualify for a tax deduction as charitable donation. The conservation organization will work with the landowner to make sure the easement meets all of the IRS requirements for a tax deduction. Among other requirements, an easement must accomplish one of the following to qualify for a tax deduction:\n\n Preserve land areas for outdoor recreation or for the education of the general public;\n Protect a significant, relatively natural habitat of fish, wildlife, or plants, or similar ecosystem;\n Preserve open space pursuant to a clearly delineated governmental conservation policy or for the scenic enjoyment of the general public, and provided the open space will offer a significant public benefit;\n Preserve a historically important land area or certified structure.\n\nThis information is intended as educational only and we strongly suggest professional advice be sought before making legal or financial commitments involving land ownership and/or management\n\nKennett Protected Lands Map 2014 \nProperties in green on the Protected Lands Map are considered protected. They include parks, township owned lands, lands under conservation easement, lands owned by homeowners associations, and lands owned by Delaware Nature Society and The Land Conservancy for Southern Chester County. The map does not include the 35-acre Case property which was placed under a conservation easement in 2014.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nApplication for Open Space Proposal\n\n\nOpen Space Preservation\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolunteer Opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgendas & Minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t801 Burrows Run Road\nChadds Ford, PA 19317\n\nPhone: 610-388-1300\nFax: 610-388-0461\nQuestions?�Send us an email: questions@kennett.pa.us\n\nOffice Hours:\n8am-4:30pm Monday-Friday\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nKennett School District\n\n\n\nKennett Borough\n\n\n\nChester County Government\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing This Site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nCopyright Notices\n\n\n\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Left\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\nSlideshow Left Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\nSlideshow Right Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

By gardening with native plants, you maintain this natural cycle of life. Moreover, gardening with native plants helps the environment by reducing pesticide use, conserving water, improving air quality, and encouraging natural biodiversity.\nNative plants have flourished in southeastern Pennsylvania for thousands of years because they have adapted to our local weather conditions and are more resistant to our pests. This means that, once established, native plants do not need pesticides, fertilizers, or extensive watering to survive. Not only is this good for the environment, it saves time and money.\nMaintenance\nBecause natives do not need to be maintained like a conventional yard, gardening with them improves the water and air quality. First, pesticides (which, if over used or inappropriately used can kill beneficial insects and other wildlife or cause serious human health problems) can be eliminated or at least minimized since natives can exist without them. Without water run-off carrying pollutants in pesticides and pollutants, water quality is improved. While lawns requires maintenance like mowing and watering, native plants, with their extensive root systems and ability to retain and store water, require little watering, and if left to grow, don�t require mowing.\nEcosystem\nFurthermore, landscaping with native plants, wildflowers, and grasses supports the ecosystem particular to this area. Diverse varieties of bird, butterflies and animals are attracted to plants native to southeastern Pennsylvania and gardening with them helps maintain the biodiversity of our region.\nBeauty\nFinally, native plants make beautiful additions to any type of garden.\nMt. Cuba\nOne of the most enchanting destinations in Northern Delaware, Mt. Cuba is home to 650 acres of rolling Piedmont hills adorned with native woodland gardens and meadows. Inexpensive tours are led year round. Look out for the Wildflower Celebration held in Spring.\nLongwood Gardens\nLongwood Gardens is a native woodlands and garden at one of the country�s finest horticultural institutions.\nResources\n\nNative Plant Listing\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us London Grove Township\n372 Rose Hill Road\nSuite 100\nWest Grove, PA 19390\nPhone: 610-345-0100\nFax: 610-345-0455\nEmail\nOffice Hours:  Monday - Friday8:00 to 4:30\n \n\nDepartments \n\nAdministration Department\nCodes Department \nFinance Department\nPublic Works Department\n\nQuick Links \nHelpful Area Links\nParks & Recreation\n\n \n\nOnline Payments \n\nClick Here\n\nFAQ�s \nClick Here\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2017 London Grove Township | All Rights Reserved | Site Developed & Maintained by Expert Solutions, Inc.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Not only is this good for the environment, it saves time and money.\nMaintenance\nBecause natives do not need to be maintained like a conventional yard, gardening with them improves the water and air quality. First, pesticides (which, if over used or inappropriately used can kill beneficial insects and other wildlife or cause serious human health problems) can be eliminated or at least minimized since natives can exist without them. Without water run-off carrying pollutants in pesticides and pollutants, water quality is improved. While lawns requires maintenance like mowing and watering, native plants, with their extensive root systems and ability to retain and store water, require little watering, and if left to grow, don�t require mowing.\nEcosystem\nFurthermore, landscaping with native plants, wildflowers, and grasses supports the ecosystem particular to this area. Diverse varieties of bird, butterflies and animals are attracted to plants native to southeastern Pennsylvania and gardening with them helps maintain the biodiversity of our region.\nBeauty\nFinally, native plants make beautiful additions to any type of garden.\nMt. Cuba\nOne of the most enchanting destinations in Northern Delaware, Mt. Cuba is home to 650 acres of rolling Piedmont hills adorned with native woodland gardens and meadows. Inexpensive tours are led year round. Look out for the Wildflower Celebration held in Spring.\nLongwood Gardens\nLongwood Gardens is a native woodlands and garden at one of the country�s finest horticultural institutions.\nResources\n\nNative Plant Listing\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us London Grove Township\n372 Rose Hill Road\nSuite 100\nWest Grove, PA 19390\nPhone: 610-345-0100\nFax: 610-345-0455\nEmail\nOffice Hours:  Monday - Friday8:00 to 4:30\n \n\nDepartments \n\nAdministration Department\nCodes Department \nFinance Department\nPublic Works Department\n\nQuick Links \nHelpful Area Links\nParks & Recreation\n\n \n\nOnline Payments \n\nClick Here\n\nFAQ�s \nClick Here\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2017 London Grove Township | All Rights Reserved | Site Developed & Maintained by Expert Solutions, Inc.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This runoff, also known as stormwater, has some obvious impacts such as flooding and erosion. Some less obvious, but equally important, impacts of stormwater runoff include increased pollution, reduced ground water supplies, and lower stream flows during dry spells.\n\nTraditionally, stormwater has been seen as a nuisance to be collected and dumped into the nearest ditch or stream and disposed of. Unfortunately, such an approach neglects the reality that most of us live or work downstream of someone else. As a result, our neighbor�s nuisance becomes our problem, which in turn becomes a problem for our downstream neighbors.\nWhat is Stormwater Management?\nManagement of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration on flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces.\nThe Township is required to obtain a permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) in order to operate a storm sewer system. The permit, called a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit, requires the Township to take certain steps to ensure that stormwater in the Township is properly managed and controlled. It also requires that the Township educate the public about storm water impacts, as well as provide opportunities for public involvement and participation. To read more about the MS4 program, permits and impacts click on the links below:\n\nNPDES permit program basics\nEPA Stormwater Program Overview\nEPA MS4 Overview\nEPA Public Education and Outreach on Stormwater Impacts\nEPA Stormwater Best Management Practices (BMP) menu\nEPA Water Homepage\nEPA Polluted Runoff: Nonprofit Source Solution\n\nLondon Grove Township prepares and submits an annual report on our ongoing efforts to achieve the above-noted minimal control measures. To request a copy of the most recent annual report, please contact London Grove Township via phone at 610.345.0100.\nStormwater Ordinance\nStormwater management in London Grove Township is regulated by Ordinance No. 183 (adopted 04.02.2014) There are different requirements for agricultural and non agricultural projects. For Non-agricultural projects, a stormwater management plan is �required if you intend to create over 1,000 s.f. of impervious surface and/or 5,000 s.f. of earth disturbance. The stormwater management plan must be submitted with the appropriate application and fees for the Township Engineer to review. You should be aware that some projects, generally larger ones, also require the review and approval of the Chester County Conservation District. If you have questions about a specific project or about stormwater management in general, feel free to contact the Township office as well.\n\nReport Illicit Discharge\nDeveloping and implementing a plan to detect and eliminate illicit discharges to the storm sewer system (includes developing a system map and informing the community about hazards associated with illegal discharges and�improper�disposal�of waste).\nWhat is illicit discharge?\nFederal regulations define an illicit discharge as any discharge to the storm sewer system that is not composed entirely of stormwater. There are exceptions to this rule: firefighting activities, landscape irrigation, foundation drains, waster from crawl space pumps etc. Sources of illicit discharges include: sanitary wastewater, failing septic systems, car wash waste water, improper disposal of household�toxins�or improper use of pesticides and herbicides etc.�Illicit�discharges enter the system wither through direct connections (deliberate pipe hookups to the storm drain system) or indirect connections (spills collected by drain outlets, or deliberate dumping down the storm drain.) These illicit discharges drain directly to the creeks and streams and may be loaded with a large amount of harmful and toxic substances. These pollutants enter the aquatic system and degrade the water quality and threaten wildlife and human health.\nLondon Grove Township, as well as many other communities in the Southern Pennsylvania region, recently was required to obtain a permit from the�Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) for its storm drainage system. This permit required the Township to�locate�and map all stormwater piping and drainage ditch systems owned and maintained by the Township. The permit also requires the Township to inspect these�drainage�systems periodically to detect any �illicit discharges� from the systems.\nWhat in the world is an illicit discharge? Simply stated, an illicit discharge is something that is exiting a storm drainage pipe or drainage ditch that is not stormwater and potentially could pollute our streams. Examples of illicit�discharges�that would be typical for a community like ours are septic system overflows, sanitary wastewater, chlorinated pool water, paints, oil or other vehicle fluids, etc.\nWhile the Township has inspected its drainage�system�thoroughly once since the permit was issued, our inspectors can not be everywhere all the time. If you happen to see something exiting a storm pipe or�ditch�that looks, smells or feels like something other than stormwater, please contact the Township so we can track it to its source and keep our streams as clean and pure as possible. To report an illicit discharge call Ken Battin at the Township, 610-345-0100 or send an email to� kbattin@londongrove.org\nPlease report illicit discharges to the Township: 610-345-0100.\nStormwater Tips\nAuto Care:�Washing your car at home on the driveway or street can send detergents and other contaminants through the storm sewer system. It is best to wash your car at a commercial car wash where the wastewater is treated and recycled. If you do wash your car at home, do so near a grassy area where the water can infiltrate into the ground. And never dump motor oil or antifreeze into the storm drain. Dispose of these at a local service station or approved recycling center.\nOnly Rain in the Drain:�Never dump anything into a storm drain, including oil, paint, soap, debris, and leaves. Storm sewers don�t go to the sewer plant but discharge directly into streams. You might be pouring oil into your own drinking water!\nPick Up After Your Dog:�Pet waste can be a major source of excess nutrients and bacteria to our streams. Always properly dispose of pet waste.\n\nWhen Your Car�s Leaking Oil On The Street, Remember It�s Not Just Leaking Oil On The Street:�Leaking oil goes from car to street, and is washed from the street into the storm drain and into our lakes, streams and into coastal waters. Now imagine the number of cars in the area and you can imagine the amount of oil that finds its way from leaky gaskets into our water. So please, fix oil leaks!\nResidential Landscaping Tips\nDownspouts:�Direct all downspouts away from pervious surfaces and onto lawns. Rain barrels can be used to collect water from downspouts, making it available for watering.\nLawn Care:�Fertilizers and pesticides should be used sparingly. When applied in excess, these chemicals are washed off by rainwater and enter the local storm sewer system. Do not sweep yard waste and leaves into the street. These add extra nutrients to streams.\nPlant Native Trees and Shrubs:�Erosion of stream banks can be prevented through the use of vegetated strips along the banks. Also known as riparian buffers, these strips of tall grasses, trees and flowers act to stabilize banks, which prevents erosion and additional sediment load in the stream. Click here for a��Native Plant List.�\nRain Gardens: A specially designed rain garden can be planted with native vegetation to that will provide an area for rainwater to collect and soak into the ground. Stormwater from rooftop drains and pavement areas can be directed to these vegetated areas.

Tuck Hunter\nAlex Hundt\nDavid Sweet, Consultant\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishment\nThis Committee was formed in January of 2005 to preserve open space in London Grove Township. The Township believes that the preservation of open space is vital to the community and the standard of living in London Grove Township. It is as much a part of a thriving community�s infrastructure as roads and utilities are.\nResponsibilities\nThe Committee, along with professional consultants, the public and the Board of Supervisors created a plan to preserve open space. The plan focuses primarily on the purchase or donation of open space and agricultural easements. Acquisition costs are funded by the Open Space Earned Income Tax (OSEIT). This tax is set at 0.25% of income earned. Since the inception of the OSEIT, a total of approximately 400 acres have been preserved via conservation easements.\nMission\nThe Open Space Committee�s mission is to identify, develop, and represent the open space interests of London Grove Township.\nGoal\nThe committee�s goal is to secure the maximum feasible amount of permanently protected open space land within London Grove Township through a variety of public and private mechanisms, in concert with the future plans and policies of the Township and its landowners\nObjectives\nThe Open Space Committee will pursue its goal through a variety of its own actions and in coordination with other groups and organizations. Its specific objectives include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nIdentify and prioritize those open space areas of the Township that warrant protected status for purposes of environmental benefit, natural features protection, and/or agriculture.\nRecommend and help coordinate additional Township mapping that will facilitate the inventory and analysis of lands targeted for protection\nDevelop a public education and outreach campaign, using newsletter, website, information meetings, individual contacts, etc. for supporting the protection of open space within the Township.\nParticipate, in concert with other London Grove Township committees and groups, in implementing the open space recommendations in the �02 and �05 addenda to the Township Comprehensive Plan, particularly with respect to open space protection measures and greenway corridor protection measures. Maintain close coordination with the Parks and Recreation Board regarding trail and greenway planning and the securing and protection of open space for recreation purposes.\nConduct, as part of an overall Township strategy, landowner contacts to secure open space and greenway protection through acquisition, easement donation, and/or landowner agreements/commitments to land management techniques.\nDevelop a plan for public purchase of open space lands or easements within the Township over the next 10 years (i.e., funds needed, sources of funding, etc.)\nDevelop and help initiate specific open space techniques and programs, including:\n\nOngoing Township participation in the County Agricultural Lands Preservation Board�s Challenge Grant program\nEstablishment of a London Grove Township Land Trust\nMembers participate in site walks and site plan reviews with other Township personnel and prospective developers re: proposals for subdivision or land development, to identify open space, resource protection, etc.\n\n\nDevelop conceptual plans for protection and management of potential open space areas and parcels in conjunction with other Township committees and groups and outside agencies, as appropriate.\nEstablish working relationships with groups (e.g. White Clay Wild and Scenic Management Committee, Brandywine Conservancy, Natural Lands Trust, etc.) that have an interest in protecting London Grove�s open space and natural resources from further encroachment by development activities.\n\nMaps\nAn important layer of information used by the Township�s Open Space Committee is the Protected Lands Map (PDF). Parcels under permanently protected status represent several categories of private and public action. Most prominent among these are:\n\nAgricultural easements sold to the Chester County Agricultural Lands Preservation Board\nPrivate conservation easements donated to a land trust such as the Brandywine Conservancy\nLand in public ownership, including the Township�s Goddard Park and Avon Grove School District properties\n\nTaken together, these properties comprise a nucleus of protected lands around which the Open Space Committee can identify additional open space protection initiatives with landowners. Adjacency to protected land is one important criterion in evaluating such lands, as protected open space corridors can yield enhanced resource benefits in terms of habitat, water quality, scenic landscape enhancement, and the like. The combined acreage of the properties shown on the Protected Lands Map is 3,081, or 27% of the total acreage in the Township.\nValue of Protected Open Space\nRead the�economic value of protected open space in southeastern Chester County.\n\n\n\n\nQuick LinksOpen Space Resource Plan\nParcels Over 10 Acres � 2012\nProtected Lands in the Township\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us London Grove Township\n372 Rose Hill Road\nSuite 100\nWest Grove, PA 19390\nPhone: 610-345-0100\nFax: 610-345-0455\nEmail\nOffice Hours:  Monday - Friday8:00 to 4:30\n \n\nDepartments \n\nAdministration Department\nCodes Department \nFinance Department\nPublic Works Department\n\nQuick Links \nHelpful Area Links\nParks & Recreation\n\n \n\nOnline Payments \n\nClick Here\n\nFAQ�s \nClick Here\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2017 London Grove Township | All Rights Reserved | Site Developed & Maintained by Expert Solutions, Inc.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Read the 2014 Chester County Planning Commission Report on��Housing and Transportation Options for Southern Chester County.��More resources for preserving land are found at Chester County Commissioners'� program:��Discover the Future�.New Garden Township's Open Space Review Board, comprised of volunteers, functions to assist landowners with planning to preserve remaining open space for present and future generations to enjoy. To accomplish this, the board members meet with property owners to discuss preservation options, to develop proposals to accomplish the easements necessary to protect the property from eventual development and to recommend satisfactory proposals to the Board of Supervisors for review toward approval. Funding for this activity is generated by a special tax levy of .00125 on earned income, approved by the citizens of the township in 2005.Board members welcome conversations with interested landowners to explore conservation possibilities and use the services of Natural Lands�to facilitate such conservations. Natural Lands�is an organization with much experience and success in protecting open space in eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey since 1953. For more information about Natural Lands, click here to visit their website.Before exploring development of a property, please consider talking with a member of the OSRB (see above) to determine conservation options. Funds are presently available for purchase of conservation easements and, in some situations, may offer comparable value to landowners to outright sale of the property with no easement.An additional task for the board is solicitation of trail easements from property owners to develop the potential trial network described in the New Garden Township Greenways Plan, adopted in 2009. The board works with the�Friends of the New Garden Trails, a volunteer organization of trail aficionados who maintain the trails, provide special programs related to the trails, and provide much of the work required when new trails are established.Board Members (3�year terms) Meet 2nd�Tuesday at 7:00pmVacantJanuary 1, 2026Chris RobinsonJanuary 1, 2026Steven DooleyJanuary 1, 2027Joe MiscioneJanuary 1, 2026Richard MeinzerJanuary 1, 2027Kecia CrowlJanuary 1, 2024Jeremy FisherJanuary 1, 2024Jack Stefferud�, Natural Lands -� OSRB Consultant�� \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Comprehensive Plan\nAnnual Reports\nGreenways & Phelps Property Plans\nTownship Greenways Plan\nTrail Prioritization Plan 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n        Contact Info      \n\n\n\n\n Meetings - When:     Every second Tuesday  \n Meetings - Where:     Township Building  \n Meetings - Time:     7:00 pm   \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews \n\n\n\n\nFY23 State of the Township - 8/28 BOS Budget Meeting Presentation \n\nCOMMUNITY DAY!- 10/7 \n\nOffice Closed- 10/9/23 \n\nBOS Budget Meeting- 10/10/23 \n\nCommunity Day/Feria Del Pueblo! \n\n\n\n    View all  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Space Review Board Calendar \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober\n\n\n\n� \n\n� \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          S        \n\n          M        \n\n          T        \n\n          W        \n\n          T        \n\n          F        \n\n          S        \n\n\n\n\n\n 1 �\n\n\n 2 �\n\n\n 3 �\n\n\n 4 �\n\n\n 5 �\n\n\n 6 �\n\n\n 7 �\n\n\n\n\n 8 �\n\n\n 9 �\n\n\n 10 �\n\n\n 11 �\n\n\n 12 �\n\n\n 13 �\n\n\n 14 �\n\n\n\n\n 15 �\n\n\n 16 �\n\n\n 17 �\n\n\n 18 �\n\n\n 19 �\n\n\n 20 �\n\n\n 21 �\n\n\n\n\n 22 �\n\n\n 23 �\n\n\n 24 �\n\n\n 25 �\n\n\n 26 �\n\n\n 27 �\n\n\n 28 �\n\n\n\n\n 29 �\n\n\n 30 �\n\n\n 31 �\n\n\n�\n\n\n�\n\n\n�\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n    All upcoming events  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAgendas \n\n\n\n  \n Open Space Review Board \n October 12, 2023 - 7:53am \n\n Open Space Review Board \n August 8, 2023 - 11:36am \n\n Open Space Review Board \n July 11, 2023 - 12:20pm \n\n Open Space Review Board \n June 13, 2023 - 11:24am \n\n Open Space Review Board \n May 9, 2023 - 11:15am \n \n\n\n    View all  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMinutes \n\n\n\n  \n Open Space Review Board \n May 9, 2023 \n\n Open Space Review Board \n April 11, 2023 \n\n Open Space Review Board \n March 14, 2023 \n\n Open Space Review Board \n February 14, 2023 \n\n Open Space Review Board \n January 10, 2023 \n \n\n\n    View all  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNew Garden Township, 299 Starr Road, Landenberg PA 19350Office Hours: 8:00-4:00 Monday�FridayPh: 610-268-2915 Fax: 610-268-0458 | office@newgarden.org\n\nLogin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

By controlling storm water runoff from new impervious and disturbed surfaces on individual properties, we can protect down stream properties, roads and infrastructure from increased flooding and protect water quality in our streams and reservoirs.\nWithout effective storm water management, problems caused by too much run off, erosion and pollutants such as sediment, nutrients and bacteria become very difficult and costly for property owners and communities to fix. Rain Garden\nRain Gardens are small vegetated areas for retention and filtration of storm water run off. Compared to a traditional lawn, a rain garden allows approximately 30 % more water to infiltrate into the ground. Rain gardens collect water from roof tops, side walks, and driveways.\nFor more Rain Garden Resources visit the following web sites:\n?

The program started in 2011, and Schuylkill Township was one of the first participants.Bird Town provides tools for municipalities to engage, educate and empower their residents, schools, and businesses to make more positive social, economic and ecologically friendly decisions. The program also promotes a culture of conservation where everyone is a potential steward of nature in their own backyard and beyond.�Backyard Habitat ProgramsSome residents may be familiar with the backyard habitat certification programs, which encourage individual property owners to improve their backyard habitat. Bird Town supports the actions of these individuals and provides additional tools that foster stewardship for the whole community. Visit the Backyard Habitat Programs webpage for more information on certifying your own backyard.Habitat Issues & Communities Can DoBirds are one of the most visible and measurable indicators of environmental health. Pennsylvania is an important place for year-round and migratory birds. However, habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation continue to negatively impact the population of birds, other wildlife, and plants.Communities can combat the impact of habitat issues by:Encouraging the use of native plants, shrubs, and treesRemoving invasive plantsImplementing storm-water management practicesReducing use of chemicals and pesticidesReducing lawnsCreating a culture of conservationRestoration of natural systems and native plant communities on both private and public lands, positively impacts our communities by creating a healthier environment, reducing storm-water runoff, increasing property values, and building community pride.VolunteerEach year the Schuylkill Township Environmental Advisory Council organizes projects that support our Bird Town status. Please consider volunteering to help with some of these efforts. Property owners seeking more information on Bird Town in Schuylkill Township or businesses interested in sponsoring conservation activities should email Karen Hilyard.�Please visit the Bird Town Pennsylvania website to learn more.Let�s work together to achieve a healthier and sustainable community for all.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBird Town Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Resource Inventory\n\n\n\n\nMedication Collection Sites\n\n\n\n\nNative & Invasive Plants\n\n\n\n\nRecycling / Waste Disposal\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial, Industrial & Institutional Establishments\n\n\n\n\nHousehold Hazardous Waste\n\n\n\n\nLeaf Disposal & Composting\n\n\n\n\nRecycling\n\n\n\n\nTrash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStormwater Management\n\n\n\n\n\nStormwater Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell Water Testing\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda & Minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport A Concern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTownship Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Zoning Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Meetings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMunicipal Office111 Valley Park RoadPhoenixville, PA 19460-5766Phone:�610-933-5843Fax:�610-933-4428Email Us\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Safety\n\n\n\nLocal Utilities\n\n\n\nCommunity Events\n\n\n\nBoard of Supervisors\n\n\n\nSchools and Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nCopyright Notices\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Left\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\nSlideshow Left Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\nSlideshow Right Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Residents can assist in the care of catch basins with the following steps:Do not sweep leaves and other lawn debris into the street as they will eventually wash into the catch basin.Remove fallen leaves and other debris from the street whenever you find them there.Ask neighbors to patrol their areas of the street for leaves.Recycle leaves and limbs at the composting centers.Curbside pickup of leaves is not done by Schuylkill Township. �Residents should contact their waste hauler for yard waste collection dates. �By Township ordinance, haulers should schedule yard waste pickup in the fall. �You may be required to put leaves and debris in recyclable bags which are available, while supplies last, at the township office for 10 cents a bag. �Never rake leaves into or near stormwater drains, ditches, creeks or the river.BurningBurning in Schuylkill Township is prohibited by township ordinance and by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.Composting YardSchuylkill Township maintains a leaf composting yard for the residents of the township. �The compost yard is located in the Valley Forge Sewer Authority complex, at:333 Pawling RoadPhoenixville, PA 19460The compost in the Township�s yard is free to residents.

The Act was expanded in 1987 to require stormwater controls at a local level. �Municipalities in Pennsylvania are required to apply for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit which is administered through the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Details on this program may be found on the PaDEP NPDES website.The program is a 5-year permit and includes six minimum control measures:�Public Outreach and EducationPublic Participation and InvolvementIllicit Discharge Detection and EliminationConstruction Site Stormwater Runoff ControlPost-Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and RedevelopmentPollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and MaintenanceAbout StormwaterStormwater is rainfall that runs off of roofs, driveways, lawns, roads, parking lots, sidewalks, farm fields, and other surfaces created or disturbed by manmade activities. �Stormwater flows over these surfaces which block natural infiltration. �Development greatly increases the runoff volume created during storms which can quickly cause flooding and erosion.Stormwater runoff enters our creeks, rivers, and oceans through storm sewers with no treatment facility buffering the impact of this water. �Whatever the water picks up on its way across the impervious surfaces in the township such as sediment, fertilizers, bacteria, oil and grease, pesticides, trash, etc. goes directly into our local streams, lakes, wetlands and rivers.Educational ResourcesBe Storm Water Smart - An MS4 Educational Brochure (PDF)After the Storm - A Citizen�s Guide to Understanding Stormwater (PDF)Stormwater Management for Small Projects (PDF)Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff (PDF)Neighborhood Stormwater Facilities (PDF)Stormwater ManagementYour roof, yard, driveway, and walkway, as well as sidewalks and streets are all connected to Schuylkill Township�s stormwater management system through storm drains, swales, curbing, and drainage ditches. Most people do not understand that storm drains are the entry point into the storm sewer system, and that stormwater runoff leaving these systems does not get collected and treated like sanitary wastewater. �Inlets connect to pipes which eventually discharge to swales, ditches and streams and finally to the Schuylkill River. Through storm drain marking, Schuylkill Township hopes to increase our residents� awareness about the connection between their yards and the storm sewer system. � The storm drain marker project is one of many activities aimed at preventing dirt, oil, pesticides, fertilizers, trash, pet waste, and household chemicals from entering into our waterways through the Township�s storm sewer system, such as the Pickering Reservoir, an important local drinking water resource.What You Can DoThere are steps that everyone can take to reduce the number of pollutants - trash, debris, pet wastes, and chemicals - carried by stormwater. The most basic way to help is to never dump anything you wouldn�t drink or swim in down a storm drain. Other ways to help include picking up pet wastes, properly disposing of household chemicals such as paints and cleaning supplies, sweeping driveways and sidewalks instead of hosing them, and washing cars at car wash facilities or on lawns rather than in driveways, and keeping inlets and swales clear of debris and leaves. For more information, contact the Township offices. And the next time it rains, consider where the stormwater drains!ResourcesWhen It Rains It Drains Brochure (PDF)Report IssuesEmail stormwater issues or concerns to the Township office or call 610-933-5843.ResourcesHomeownersHomeowners Guide to Stormwater Best Management Protections Maintenance (PDF) - What you need to know to take care of your propertyReducing Runoff - Townships Today Summer 2015Be a Clean Water Partner (PDF)Eco-Friendly Fertilizer for Free (PDF)Hazardous Waste Disposal - Chester County Solid Waste AuthorityChester Ridley Crum Watersheds AssociationIllicit Discharge DetectionCommercialFor the Construction Industry - Stormwater and the Construction IndustryKidsResources for Students and EducatorsWater - Use It Wisely Kids Pagehttp://wateruseitwisely.com/kids/Water Cycle Glossary of TermsTeachersWhat You Can Do: In Your ClassroomBuild Your Own Watershed\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nStormwater Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda & Minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport A Concern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTownship Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Zoning Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Meetings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMunicipal Office111 Valley Park RoadPhoenixville, PA 19460-5766Phone:�610-933-5843Fax:�610-933-4428Email Us\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Safety\n\n\n\nLocal Utilities\n\n\n\nCommunity Events\n\n\n\nBoard of Supervisors\n\n\n\nSchools and Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nCopyright Notices\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Left\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\nSlideshow Left Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\nSlideshow Right Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Members of the Environmental Advisory Council, who serve three-year staggered terms, are dedicated to promoting environmental initiatives in the Township. They are joined by one Township liaison each from the Parks and Recreation Board and the Planning Commission.� A Tredyffrin Township Engineer and a Township Supervisor attend meetings and participate in EAC discussions, as well.�\n\nThe Environmental Advisory Council works at the direction of the Tredyffrin Township Board of Supervisors and as an extension of Township staff to research environmental issues and funding sources; to advise Township staff and supervisors; to undertake or sponsor environmental education; to partner with Township residents, outside agencies, and organizations with similar interests; and to coordinate environmental projects.��\nStrategic Plan\n\nWatersheds: Promote stream health in the Township�s seven watersheds by addressing such issues as water quality and quantity, stormwater management, watershed restoration and protection, and community involvement.� Efforts include the implementation and management of both tree and live-stake planting, installation of riparian buffers, and creation of rain gardens. \nEducational Initiatives: Publicize the Township's environmental and educational initiatives, which include the benefits of planting trees and live stakes to improve stormwater control, use of riparian buffers, such as tall grasses and shrubs, and the preservation of bird habitat. \nEnvironmental Initiatives: Research and promote environmental initiatives to protect natural resources and improve the quality of life in Tredyffrin.\n\n�\n\nAt the June 15, 2020 Board of Supervisors meeting, the Board approved the Environmental Resource Fund Policy. The purpose of this Special Revenue Fund is to support township initiatives focused on promoting stream health in the Township�s seven watersheds, publicizing the Township�s environmental and educational initiatives, and researching and promoting environmental initiatives to protect natural resources and improve the quality of life in Tredyffrin.�More information on the Environmental Resource Fund can be found here.\n�\nEnvironmental Advisory Council\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers\nTERM EXPIRES�\n\n\n\n\nAmber Atwood Levy,�Chair\n�2/8/2026\n\n\nEduardo Due�as, Vice-chair\n�2/8/2024\n\n\nRutger Boerema�\n�2/8/2025\n\n\nJennifer Cox\n\n�2/8/2026\n\n\nThomas Szwech\n�2/8/2024�\n\n\nAnne Murphy\n\n�2/8/2025\n\n\nJonathan Wilson\n�2/8/2024\n\n\nAlison Andrel - Historical Commission Liaison\n�\n\n\nMeg Hamilton -�Park & Rec Board Liaison\n�\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            KS Bhaskar - Board of Supervisors Liaison\n�\n\n\nKate Vaccaro - Planning Commission Liaison\n�\n\n\nRobert Emmanuel�- Staff Liaison\n�\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\nASSOCIATE MEMBERS\nTERM EXPIRES\n\n\n\n\nSigne Hansen\n�2/8/2023\n\n\nSusanne Hay\n�2/8/2023\n\n\nTracy Viola\n�2/8/2023\n\n\nPhil Witmer\n�2/8/2023\n\n\nLilly Shui, High School Associate Member\n�2/8/2023\n\n\nAishi Debroy, High School Associate Member\n�2/8/2023\n\n\n\nMeeting Minutes\nContact the EAC via email.\nEnvironmental Advisory Council Pages \n\nFacebook\nComposting� \nEvents Around the Township�� \nHousehold Hazardous Waste Collection\nEAC Newsletters\n\nLinks\n\nSidewalk, Trails, and Paths \nPennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection\nTestimony of PA Secretary Patrick McDonnell - Climate Change Priorities [PDF]\nClean Energy Resolution - September 16, 2019 [PDF]�\n\nFor more information on Tredyffrin's park, recreation and open spaces go to our�Park and Recreation page. \n\n\nTodayNext 7 daysNext 30 daysAll UpcomingAll PastAllEventDate/TimeAgendaOtherEnvironmental Advisory Council10/24/2023 7:00 PM 10/24/2023 7:00 PM 10/24/2023Not IncludedNot Included\n\nEnvironmental Advisory Council11/28/2023 7:00 PM 11/28/2023 7:00 PM 11/28/2023Not IncludedNot Included\n\n\n\n\n\t\tFree viewers are required for some of the attached documents.They can be downloaded by clicking on the icons below.\n\t\n\nAcrobat Reader\n\n\n\nWindows Media Player\n\n\n\n\nWord Viewer\n\n\n\nExcel Viewer\n\n\n\nPowerPoint Viewer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nServices\nProjects\nBoards\nResidents\nBusiness\nI Want To...\n\n\n\n\nTredyffrin Township\n1100 DuPortail Road\nBerwyn, PA 19312\n\nPhone: 610-644-1400\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with Tredyffrin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Design by Granicus - Connecting People and Government\n\n\n\nView Full Site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This volunteer-led group has installed an educational rain garden at the Tredyffrin Public Library and launched the residential rain garden program in 2022.\nRain gardens are excellent for areas like Tredyffrin, which has seen significant damage from stormwater. Fewer trees, more impervious surfaces and a change in how much and how fast precipitation is falling all contribute to a rather expensive and unhealthy problem. Rain gardens can help by absorbing approximately 30-40% more water than a typical lawn. They also can help recharge the ground water by allowing more stormwater to filter through naturally. They decrease the amount of stormwater running straight off of impervious surfaces into our streams, which decreases the pollutants and salt in our stream water. Since they are planted using all native and deer-resistant plants, they also give local pollinators and wildlife places to thrive. \nResidents of Tredyffrin can apply to receive a rain garden on their property. Residents will have a co-pay of $100 and will have an obligation to take care of the garden for many years, will have to display a sign, will have to volunteer hours back to the program and more. However, the remaining cost of installing the garden will be covered by a grant the Township received and with volunteer hours. This is neighbors helping neighbors to solve a problem that affects us all.\n\n\n\n*The Fall 2023 Application period is now open.*\n*Please note that properties must meet certain requirements that include having appropriate soil, slope and public visibility to receive a garden. Applicants who do not receive a rain garden will be encouraged to apply for our next round, encouraged to volunteer so they gain the knowledge to install on their own and will be given educational resources to help them take action on stormwater and pollution.*\n\nResidents who are interested in volunteering with the Tredyffrin Rain Gardens group can email�TredyffrinRainGardens@gmail.com.\n\n\n\n�\n�\n�\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n\nTAKING ACTION\nAre you ready to take action on stormwater, water pollution, helping pollinators and more? Here are some things that you can do on your own:\n\nPlant an Oak Tree. Learn more about how shade trees absorbs loads of water and help our community here.\nCreate a rain garden on your property. Learn more here.\nRedirect your downspouts so that more water is absorbed rather than sent via impervious surfaces to our streams.

It is the best, most efficient way to recycle your yard and kitchen wastes, and is a critical step in reducing the volume of garbage needlessly sent to landfills for disposal. It's easy to learn how to compost!\nComposting is not a new idea. In the natural world, this same process occurs as leaves pile up on the forest floor and begin to decay. Eventually, the rotting leaves are returned to the soil, where living roots can finish the recycling process by reclaiming the nutrients from the decomposed leaves. \nToday, the use of composting to turn organic wastes into a valuable resource is expanding rapidly throughout the United States and in other countries, as landfill space becomes scarce and expensive, and as people become more aware of the impacts they have on the environment. \n\nResidents are encouraged to contribute to the \"composting revolution\" by recycling yard and kitchen waste on their own property. Your privately contracted trash hauler will also provide several dates in the Fall which they pick up leaves and yard waste from your property. However, for those who are not able to do so, the Township provides a compost site at 1542 Mill Road, Malvern, PA�for residents of Tredyffrin Township and contractors hired by Tredyffrin residents. This site is open periodically throughout the year.\nMill Road Leaf Site Hours of Operation:\nWEEKDAYS (Monday through Thursday; CLOSED FRIDAY'S) - 7:30am to 2:30pm\nMonday, October 16th through�Thursday, December 14th (closed�Wednesday, November 23rd, &�Thursday, November 24th)��\nSATURDAY'S - 9:00am to 3:00pm\nSaturday, October 21st through Saturday, December 16th (closed Saturday, November 11th)\nDuring the Spring/Summer months, the Mill Road Leaf Site is open the first Monday of every month.

The permit MUST be signed by the property owner and will only be valid for that specific property. The permit will indicate the number of loads of leaves to be removed from the property. The permit MUST be brought with EACH load to be dumped or you will not be permitted to dump. The Township employee checking the permit will sign and date each load dumped. After the last load allowed by the permit is dumped, the permit will be turned in and kept at the leaf site. Additional loads for that property will require an additional permit.\nLeaf Hauling�Permit Application costs $50.00 per vehicle per season. Permit sticker must be attached to each vehicle.�Permits will be issued at the Tredyffrin Township Administration�Building,�Monday through Thursday, 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM.

The inlets in the streets are interconnected by piping and eventually discharged to a larger pipe, to a stream or ditch. Eventually all of our runoff ends up in the Schuylkill and/or Delaware River.\nInlets are spaced along a roadway with most located at low points of the street in order to efficiently collect rainwater. Residents may help themselves by insuring that the opening is free and clear of leaves and other debris prior to a rain storm. If the inlet is clogged and not accepting runoff, the Public Works Department should be called at (610) 408-3620 or email.\nStreams and drainage ditches/swales are also conveyors of the runoff. Dumping or raking leaves and other garden debris into these channels hurts the environment and seriously impacts drainage down stream. This action is prohibited by Township Ordinance and the regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.\nGuidelines for waste water discharge (including swimming pool and hot tubs)\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) regulates waste water discharge and has provided�guidelines for waste water discharge [PDF]�that all residents must follow.\nAuthorized discharge into the sanitary sewer system: One option residents have to comply with DEP's guidelines is to discharge water into the sanitary sewer system - with Township approval. The Public Works Department will grant approval if the residents follow the DEP Guidelines for waste water disposal, the water conforms to the sewage treatment plant requirements, and there is a public sewer in close proximity to the pool discharge point. The cost for the discharge is $6.51 per thousand (1,000) gallons.\n\nPool Water Discharge Permit�[PDF] \n\nComplaints about improper water disposal: If a resident is reported to be discharging waste water into any street or stream, or into the sanitary sewer system without Township approval, please contact the Township (610-644-1400) immediately. If a resident needs to report improper waste water disposal after business hours, please call the Police (911).\nLinks\n\nPennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection \nLink to DEP Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual \nChester County Water Resources Authority \nChester County Conservation District� \nEPA NPDES \nEPA Nonpoint Source Outreach Digital Toolbox \nCenter for Watershed Protection - Stormwater Manager's Resource Center\nCRC, Media and Nether Providence Work to Multiply Rain Gardens\n\nStormwater Management Ordinances\n\nIllicit Discharge Ordinance�[PDF] \nStormwater Management Ordinance�[PDF] \n\nStormwater Educational Resources\n\nGuidelines for Maintaining Streams in your Community - PADEP [PDF]\nWe All Live Down Stream�[PDF] \nClean Water Begins with You�[PDF] \nHow Much Rain can a Tree Retain?

Stormwater point discharges to waters of the U.S. are regulated using National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. In 1999, federal regulations extended coverage of the NPDES program to local separate storm sewer systems (MS4�s) serving populations less than 100,000. Upper Uwchlan Township is required to comply with the NPDES program as an MS4. Under the NPDES stormwater program, permittees must develop a stormwater management plan that provides the details of how the community will comply with the requirements of the permit. Permits are based on a framework of six minimum control measures:Public education and outreachPublic participation and involvementIllicit discharge detection and eliminationConstruction site runoff controlPost-construction storm water management in new development and redevelopmentPollution prevention and good housekeeping for municipal operations and maintenance\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nActive Stormwater ProjectsIn 2018, Upper Uwchlan Township was awarded grant funding through the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for a stormwater management project. The Township�s project, Restoration of the Marsh Creek Watershed, was one of 61 projects selected by the DEP. The project will include the restoration of approximately 700 linear feet of streambank to a tributary of the Marsh Creek, the construction of a naturalized detention basin at Upland Farms and the naturalization of Township owned detention basins located off of Heather Hill Drive.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nReport An Illicit DischargeIf you have observed illegal dumping of any materials - e.g., used oil, soap/detergents or other compounds, waste water, trash, or yard waste - into a street, storm drain, or watercourse, please report this discharge via the Township's Report a Concern map.�\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUpper Uwchlan Township's Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)Upper Uwchlan Township is a participant in and is complying with all the requirements of the�Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) program. The goals of the MS4 program and Upper Uwchlan Township are to reduce the discharge of pollutants from the Township, to protect water quality, and to satisfy requirements of the Clean Water Act. Please remember that the water, and any items that go into a storm sewer, goes directly into local streams. This water is not cleaned in any way and does not go to the waste water treatment plant. Residents can assist in keeping our stormwater and stormwater system clean by doing the following: dispose of water properly, clean up after your pets, use fertilizers properly and efficiently to prevent excess runoff, and store potential pollutants indoors. Please monitor stormwater inlets near your property. No one should dump anything into the storm sewer system. If you see someone dumping please call the township at 610-458-9400.Watersheds Located in Upper Uwchlan TownshipBrandywine Creek - East BranchPickering Creek WatershedView Watersheds Map of Chester CountyResourcesFor more information about stormwater management, please see the information displayed on bulletin boards in the township building and other various businesses throughout Eagle Village.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nMaintenance Tips for HomeownersLawn CareSet lawnmower height to three (3) inches or taller.Maintain thick vegetative cover, which allows for infiltration and reduces erosion.Keep grass clippings on the lawn and out of streets and storm drains.Use grass and leaf clippings, which are high in nutrients, as a �natural fertilizer.�Do not apply fertilizer before spring or within 15-20 feet of a stream or waterway.Leaves and Yard WasteDo not rake or blow leaves into the roadway.Keep leaves out of storm drains and out of our waterways.Leaves in the street end up in storm drains, and drains full of leaves lead to floods. Bag leaves and yard waste in biodegradable bags or open containers and place curbside on designated yard waste days.Snow RemovalShovel first! Deicers are only effective on surfaces where minimal snow has accumulated.�Pile snow downslope on vegetated areas to prevent runoff when snow melts.Minimize use of chemical deicers and salts - Add sand or kitty litter for increased traction.�Limit where you apply deicers to heavily �trafficked areas.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAgency Links�Chester County Conservation DistrictChester County Water Resources AuthorityDepartment of Environmental Protection Stormwater Management ProgramChristina Watershed Municipal PartnershipPartnership for the Delaware EstuaryAdditional ResourcesEPA: National Menu of Stormwater Best Management PracticesEPA: Stormwater Discharges from MS4s EPA: What You Can Do - Healthy WatershedsDEP: How to be Storm Water SmartDEP: Management of Cleaning Wastewater Fact SheetFEMA: Protect Your Home from FloodingHome Advisor: Stormwater Best Practices for HomeownersPenn State Extension: Guide to Proper Pet Waste DisposalOSU College of Engineering: Freshwater PollutionAlabama Cooperative Extension: Understanding Types of Water PollutionProject Oceanography: Pollution and Water QualityTexas Cooperative Extension: What is Water Pollution?\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nMore Downloadable Documents\n\n\n\n\n\nBe StormWater Smart MS4 Brochure 4-29-2020\n\nChester County Annual Water Status Report 2019\n\nHealthy Benefits of Green Infrastructure - EPA\n\nHomeowners Guide to Stormwater BMP Maintenance\n\nHomeowners Guide to Stormwater Management\n\nIllicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Fact Sheet\n\nProtecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff - EPA\n\nStormwater Place Mat\n\nSwimming Pool Discharge and Disposal Guidelines \n\nWhen It Rains It Drains Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nParks\n\n\nReport a Concern\n\n\nStaff Directory\n\n\nStormwater Management\n\n\nStreams\n\n\nStreets\n\n\nTrash & Recycling\n\n\nWastewater\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotify Me�Sign up for notifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a ConcernHow can we help you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Bill PayEasy, one-stop payment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgendas & MinutesStay up to date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStormwaterStormwater Management Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParks & FacilitiesOpen space and athletic facilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrash & RecyclingFind pick-up and billing information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpper Uwchlan Township140 Pottstown PikeChester Springs, PA 19425Phone: 610-458-9400Administrative Office Hours8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.Memorial Day - September 30Monday - Thursday7:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.Friday7:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinances & Resolutions\n\n\n\nTownship Code\n\n\n\nFinancial Dashboard\n\n\n\nPermits\n\n\n\nStaff Directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome � � � � Site Map � � � � Contact Us � � � � Accessibility � � � � Copyright Notices � � � � Privacy Policy � � � � Government Websites by CivicPlus�\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Left\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\nSlideshow Left Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\nSlideshow Right Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As this water flows across surfaces it picks up\npollutants from the ground. Water that flows into stormwater drains is released\nback into natural water sources and does not go to a treatment plant.\n�\nWhere does it go?\n\n\nSewer pipes and stormwater pipes are not\nconnected!�Stormwater flows\nback out into natural bodies of water, not into treatment plants.\n�\nWhat problems does it cause?\nExamples of stormwater\npollutants include sediments, plant nutrients, metals, organic materials, oil\nand grease, pet waste, and pesticides. Since stormwater runoff does not go\nthough a treatment plant, increased amounts of pollutants entering stormwater\ndrains causes an increase in surface water pollution and lower water quality.\nProblems caused in\nwater bodies may include erosion/sedimentation, turbidity, eutrophication,\nincreased salinity and habitat disruption.�Eutrophication�results from excess plant nutrients\n(nitrogen & phosphorous�found in many fertilizers) causing an overgrowth of\nalgae, leading to decreased oxygen levels in surface waters. This creates\nproblems for aquatic life.\n�\nWhat can I do to help?\n���������\nDo not dump waste in storm drains!\n���������\nClean up pet waste.\n���������\nLandscape with fewer\nhard-paved (impervious) surfaces.\n���������\nPrevent erosion by\nvegetating bare soil.\n���������\nReduce pesticide use.\n���������\nClean up\nauto/household chemical spills with absorbents instead of rinsing with water.\n���������\nDo not litter.\n���������\nDo not dump grass\nclippings and other yard waste into street curbs and drains.\n�\n�\nStormwater Regulations\nThe�National�Pollutant�Discharge�Elimination�System�(NPDES)�program was established by the federal government to\ncontrol discharges of water pollution. The NPDES Permitting and Compliance\nPrograms of Pennsylvania�s Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) is\nresponsible for administering the program for the state. Goals are set to\nimprove the water quality using the 6 key elements of NPDES Phase II ��Municipal�Separate�Storm�Sewer�System�(MS4)�Program.\nWhat is an MS4?\nAn MS4 is a conveyance\nor system of conveyances that is:\n���������\nOwned by a state,\ncity, town, village, or other public entity that discharges to waters of the\nU.S.;\n���������\nDesigned or used to\ncollect or convey stormwater (including storm drains, pipes, ditches, etc.);\n���������\nNot a combined sewer;\nand\n���������\nNot part of a Publicly\nOwned Treatment Works (sewage treatment plant).\n�\n\nWhat are Best Management Practices (BMPs)\nBest Management\nPractice (BMP): Activities, facilities, designs, measures, or procedures used\nto manage stormwater impacts from regulated activities, to meet state water\nquality requirements, to promote groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet\nthe purposes of this Ordinance. Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one\nof two broad categories or measures: �structural� or �nonstructural.� In this\nOrdinance, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or\nbehavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants\nwith stormwater runoff whereas structural BMPs or measures are those that\nconsist of a physical device or practice that is installed to capture and treat\nstormwater runoff. Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide\nvariety of practices and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and\nconstructed wetlands, to small-scale underground treatment systems,\ninfiltration facilities, filter strips, low impact design, bioretention, wet\nponds, permeable paving, grassed swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters,\ndetention basins, and manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are\npermanent appurtenances to the project site.\n6� Minimum Control Measures (MCMs)\n1.����\nPublic\nEducation and Outreach�� Educate the public\nabout stormwater and the importance of protecting water quality.\n2.����\nPublic\ninvolvement�� Involve the public\nin developing, implementing, and reviewing MS4 management programs and\ndescribes ways to reduce stormwater pollution.\n3.����\nIllicit\nDischarge regulations�-� Identifying\nand eliminating illicit discharges and spills to storm drain systems.\n4.����\nConstruction\nsite runoff regulations (Erosion and Sedimentation Control)�-� Address stormwater runoff from active\nconstruction sites.\n5.����\nPost-construction\nsite runoff regulations (BMP�s)�� Sddress stormwater runoff after construction activities have\nended.\n6.����\nPollution\nprevention and good housekeeping (for municipal operations)- Aims to reduce water pollution through\nprevention and good housekeeping practices related to municipal operations.\n�\nFor Additional Information\nPlease Check Out the Following Links:\n���������\nWhat is a Watershed\nBrochure\n���������\nGreen Guide for\nProperty Management\n���������\nChester County Water Resource Authority\n���������\nStormwaterPA\n���������\nEPA Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)\nInformation\n���������\nPA DEP MS4 Information\nResources\n���������\nMS4 FAQ � PA Department\nof Environmental Protection (PA DEP)\n���������\nPA DEP � Stormwater Management\n���������\nMap of Pennsylvania�s\nNPDES MS4 Permitting Program\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright �2012 Wallace \nTownship1250 Creek Road, P.O.

Chester County prepared the County-wide Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan and it was approved July 2, 2013 by the PA Department of Environmental Proctection (PA DEP). The PA DEP, through Act 167, required that all Chester County municipalities adopt the ordinance requirements included �in the Plan. West Caln Township adopted the County's model ordinance, West Caln Township Stormwater Management Ordinance, on April 21, 2014.\nAll projects that involve adding 1000 square feet or more of impervious surface or disturbing more than 5000 square feet of earth are subject to the Storm Water Management Ordinance. Projects between 1000-2000 square feet may use the Simplified Approach, which does not require the services of an engineer. There are more specific requirements, including cumulative projects, and exemptions within the Ordinance and we recommend reviewing the following documents and contacting the Township office with specific questions regarding your plans. \nStormwater requirements must be met and approved by the township engineer before a\nBuilding or Zoning Permit will be issued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORMWATER REVIEW APPLICATION DOCUMENTS\nPlease print and use both documents in your preparation for submitting a Stormwater Plan.�\nSTORMWATER MANAGEMENT EXPLANATION &�SUMMARY\nSTORMWATER MANAGEMENT SIMPLIFIED APPROACH PRE-DESIGNED PLAN\nAPPLICATION FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT REVIEW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORMWATER MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE\n\n\n\n\n\nStorm Water Management OrdinanceAppendix for Stormwater- Simplified Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome | Township Directory & Contact Information | General Information | Township Meeting Agenda & Minutes | Ordinance & Resolutions | Planning Commission | Building & Zoning | Stormwater Management: Ordinance & Requirements | Parks & Recreation Commission | Historical Society & Commission | Police Department | Fire Marshal | Emergency Services - Food Bank | Sewage Management Program  | Zoning Hearing Board | Superfund Site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

There are also a few bird nest boxes placed around the campus to encourage cavity nesters such as bluebirds and tree swallows.  Bird Town Pennsylvania�s mission is to work in partnership with local municipalities and like-minded organizations promoting community-based conservation actions to create a healthier, more sustainable environment for birds, wildlife, and people.  Their goal is to engage all property owners and managers who care about providing good habitat for ecological diversity and a sustainable future. Their vision is to build highways of sustenance and safety to counterbalance the tremendous loss of living space for birds, plants, and all native species.West Vincent EAC and volunteers hope to educate, engage, empower and provide residents with:Native plant informationInvasive plant identification and removal informationBird friendly habitat resourcesLandscaping tipsBird population decline informationBird window strikes actionsBackyard habitat recognition programsBird feeding tipsPesticide alternativesOriginally, part of Audubon PA, Bird Town Pennsylvania has been revived under the guidance of many municipal Bird Town leaders in partnership with local Audubon societies (Valley Forge, Bucks County, Lehigh Valley, and Wyncote Audubon Society, as well as the Pennsylvania Audubon Council).  West Vincent EAC is very excited that this program is active again, as it supports the EAC goal to promote planting native plants for pollinators and biodiversity. Additional resources for attracting and caring for birds can be found on the WV EAC page.

Delany, EAC Chair\n\nOur Pollinator Pitstop garden in Evans Park is having its first birthday! �\nTo celebrate, we are giving away 100 New England Aster plants. �\n\nTo pick up your baby aster, meet us at the Pollinator Pitstop in Evans Park near the Rt. 401 parking area on Wednesday, May 24, 7:30 p.m. - 8:30p.m. (rain date May 25). Please RSVP just to let us know your interest; otherwise, just walk on up and meet us! ��If you love to talk about nature and gardening or if you have any questions, please stay and chat! �If this time is not good for you, email us at eac@westvincenttwp.org to make other arrangements.�\n\nThe flowers in the Pitstop look so happy! �They bloom all summer long, but pollinators need food in spring and fall, too. �We are gathering on May 24 to add New England Aster and �Solar Cascade� Goldenrod to the Pitstop, extending the bloom time until the end of fall. �Asters and goldenrods bloom until a hard frost. Their purple and yellow flowers look pretty for people and feed those hungry Monarchs as they head south.\n\nBoth asters and goldenrods are �Keystone Species�. A keystone species is an organism that helps define an entire ecosystem. Without its keystone species, the ecosystem would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether. By planting Keystone plants in our yards, we can have a strong positive effect on the health of our environment. �New England Asters look like small, pretty shrubs during spring and summer. �In fall, they are transformed into mounds of purple flowers. �Goldenrod is usually a large plant that might overwhelm the average garden, but Solar Cascade, the cultivar of Canada Goldenrod that we chose for the pitstop, is a well-behaved garden plant that looks like golden fireworks when blooming in the fall.\n\nFor more information on our Pollinator Pitstop program, check out our web page. �You will find descriptions of the plants and the planting plan. �\n\nThis is a program of the West Vincent Environmental Advisory CouncilRead More >Share This EventWV EAC - Garden Demo - The Lasagna MethodWEST VINCENT TOWNSHIP\n�\n729 St. Matthews Road\nChester Springs, PA 19425\n�\nP: 610-458-1601\nF: 610-458-1603\n?\nOffice Hours: \n8:30A - 4:30P, Monday - Friday�POLICE\n?\nEMERGENCIES CALL 911\n?\nNon Emergency\nP: 610-458-3205\nF: 610-458-3206\nE: admin@wvpolice.org\n?\nOffice Hours: 8:30A - 4:30P, Monday - Friday\n\nChester County Dispatch: 610-935-2440 (non-emergency)\n?Privacy Policy� - Disclaimer - Terms of UseFIRE\n?\nKimberton Fire Company\nLudwigs Corner Fire Company\nRidge Fire Company\nUwchlan Ambulance\n�\nPECO� � � � � �800-841-4141\nPENNDOT� ��1-800-FIX-ROAD2021 West Vincent Township - created with WIXbottom of page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Please:Monitor storm sewer inlets near your property. �No one should be dumping anything into the storm sewer system. �Contact the Police Department at 610-647-1440 immediately if you witness illegal dumping.Clean up after your pets and dispose of their waste properly.Use fertilizers properly and efficiently to prevent excess runoff.Properly store materials that could contaminate water supply.Report any chemical spills.Read the Be Stormwater Smart Brochure or watch the short video.Report Violations or ProblemsCitizens are important advocates for the health of our local streams and water systems. To report a concern, see the list of events to report and whom to contact.Additional InformationTownship residents can learn more about these regulations and the need to improve stormwater quality by visiting the DEP website, or reviewing the Chester-Ridley-Crum Watersheds Association website.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWillistown TownshipCharles E.

Understanding more about Stormwater Runoff will help you do your part to help keep our water clean.Stormwater Management for Building ProjectsOn December 13, 2022 the Borough of Phoenixville adopted a new Stormwater Management Ordinance to minimize the impacts of new development, redevelopment and other earth disturbance activities to protect, sustain and enhance the quality and quantity of all water resources to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and preserve the diverse natural resources and aesthetic and recreational assets of Phoenixville Borough, Chester County and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)In addition to the requirements under local zoning and ordinances, federal regulations require individual land development projects to obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for all land development projects that disturb one acre or more. The 1999 update to the federal stormwater regulations also required municipalities throughout Pennsylvania to obtain NPDES permits for their stormwater discharges. Each permit holder must implement and enforce a stormwater management program that reduces the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable.Chester County Water Resources AuthorityChester County�s Water Resources Authority, through Act 167, has created a county-wide integrated water resources management plan that includes the implementation of the local stormwater ordinance (PDF). More information is available on their website.The Chester County Water Resources Authority has prepared a Homeowner and Small Projects Factsheet (PDF) to accompany the following changes. A guide (PDF) created to assist you to develop and implement a stormwater management plan for your property has been created.ApplicationView or download the Stormwater Management Application (PDF).AppendicesView or download the�Stormwater Management Simplified Approach Appendices (PDF).Flood Insurance Rate MapsThe state Department of Community and Economic Development maintains a website containing the new Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The site will help users determine if they are located in a floodplain and assist local officials in their creation of floodplain-management strategies to ensure public safety\n\n\n\n\n\n MS4 Program\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenixville�s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) ProgramClick here to view the 2022 MS4 videoUntreated and uncontrolled stormwater runoff is the number one cause of impairment in local Pennsylvania waterways. Polluted runoff is often transported through municipal stormwater systems where it is eventually discharged into streams.The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established a municipal stormwater management program known as the MS4 Program that is intended to improve water quality of the waterways in the United States, by reducing the quantities of pollutants that stormwaters can carry into stormsewer systems during storm events.Contact the MS4 ProgramFor additional information concerning the MS4 program or to learn more about volunteer opportunities, please Email MS4 ProgramDischarge PermitAs part of the MS4 Program, the Borough of Phoenixville, like other municipalities, holds a permit to discharge stormwater into the local waterways.As part of this permit, the Borough is responsible for overseeing a stormwater management program that reduces the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent possible, and that satisfies the water quality requirements of the Clean Water Act. In Pennsylvania, the MS4 program is administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).Program ElementsThe MS4 stormwater management program has six elements known as �minimum control measures� (MCM). It is intended that implementation of these six MCMs will result in an immediate and long-term reduction of pollutants that are discharged into waterways.

It is opened to the residents the 2nd Saturday of each month from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm\nBenefits of Compost\nPromotes Soil Health\nCompost supplies organic matter to soil, which attracts earthworms and stimulates beneficial soil microorganisms. Compost also performs the the following:\nIncreases soil water holding capacityIncreases soil nutrient retentionImproves soil tilth and friability\nImproves soil drainageLoosens heavy clay soils\nSuppresses soil-borne plant pathogens (diseases)\nPlant Nutrients\nAlthough compost is not a fertilizer, it does contain many trace nutrients that are essential for plant growth. Nitrogen and phosphorus, mostly in organic forms, are released slowly to plants and not readily leached from the topsoil.\nDocuments for Download\nComposting Naturally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n136 Modena Road South Coatesville, PA 19320\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(610) 384-1700\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Links \n\n\n\n Coatesville Area Public LibraryChester County Planning CommissionStormwater Discharges from Municipal SourcesChester County SWA RecyclingChester CountyReady ChesCo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCopyright � 2023 Borough of South Coatesville.

Some of the water infiltrates into gravel and soil beneath the garden, and sediment and pollutants settle out or are filtered by hardy plants.You can get involved in the Borough�s rain gardens and keep them looking their best. Volunteers will be involved in plant selection, planting, and light garden maintenance, and most importantly making sure the infrastructure is working as intended.�Participation is contingent on volunteer attendance at an annual training in March, held in conjunction with the Borough's rain garden maintenance provider, and volunteers must sign off on basic rules for participation and a liability waiver. Participation may be capped at 1-2 volunteers per small garden, and 2-3 volunteers for larger gardens.�Sign up as a new or repeat volunteer here!�E-mail the Borough's Sustainability Director with questions at wwilliams@west-chester.com.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAgendas and Minutes\n\n\n\n\nAdopt-a-Rain Garden\n\n\n\n\nClean Energy\n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather Energy Saving Tips\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Procurement\n\n\n\n\nSolar PV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleanup\n\n\n\n\nEV Charging\n\n\n\n\nRecycling\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Recycling\n\n\n\n\nElectronics Recycling\n\n\n\n\nRecycling Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle Use Plastics\n\n\n\n\nStormwater Management\n\n\n\n\nWest Chester Sustainable!

The program is designed to manage stormwater, both by protecting water quality and by preventing high volumes of runoff from causing flooding in developed areas. Any municipality with a population of at least 5,000, including counties, must comply with the program. The Stream Protection Fee Program was implemented in 2017 as a way to comply with this mandate by raising revenue to comprehensively address stormwater management in the borough.Water PollutionWater pollution degrades surface waters making them unsafe for drinking, fishing, swimming, and other activities. As authorized by the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program controls water pollution by regulating point sources that release pollutants into waters of the United States. Point sources can be pipes or man-made ditches that carry stormwater from the street level to the nearest stream.When left uncontrolled, these discharges can result in fish kills, destruction of wildlife habitats, and contamination of drinking water and recreational waterways. Sediment from yard debris and construction sites can cause stream bank erosion, vegetation destruction, and flooding. It is therefore extremely important to recognize that individual actions can multiply the effect on water quality.Factors to PollutionConcentrated development in urbanized areas substantially increases impervious surfaces, such as streets, driveways and parking lots. These surfaces are the primary collector of pollutants until a rain washes them into nearby storm drains. Common pollutants include pesticides, fertilizers, oils, salt, litter, and sediment. Storm drains do not run to treatment plants. They empty directly into waterways.Protecting Water QualityBecause West Chester owns the stormwater conveyance system within the municipal boundaries, the responsibility lies with the borough to ensure that any water pollution entering the system is minimized to the fullest extent possible. The borough strives to protect water quality through:Education of residents, businesses, developers, and its own staffUse of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce the discharge of pollutants into streamsFor instance, a large component of the program is the requirement that the borough screens its stormwater outfalls for potential conditions of pollution and takes corrective action in the event a pollutant source is found.Citizen Participation & AwarenessAnother major component of the program requires an effort by the borough to increase citizen participation and awareness. It is important for West Chester's residents and businesses to be aware that increased stormwater runoff and pollution can occur from many different sources, and can cause a number of different problems.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon EdwardsDirector of Public Works205 Lacey StreetWest Chester, PA 19380Office: 610-696-5282Fax: 610-436-1383E-mailOffice HoursMonday-Friday8:00 AM - 4:00 PM\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChester County Conservation District\n\n\n\nChester County Water Resources Authority\n\n\n\nChester - Ridley - Crum Watersheds Association\n\n\n\n\n\nView All Links\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nStream Protection Fee Program\n\n\n\n\nReducing Pollutants\n\n\n\n\nReport Problem or Violation\n\n\n\n\nEPA Fact Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Month�s Meetings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermit & Parking Tickets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Requests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREADYChesCo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401 East Gay StreetWest Chester, PA 19380Phone: 610-692-7574Fax: 610-436-0009\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlarm Registration\n\n\n\nEmployment Opportunities\n\n\n\nFood Vendor License\n\n\n\nHARB Ceritificate of Appropriateness\n\n\n\nInspection & Testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credits\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nCopyright / Privacy\n\n\n\nLegal Notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow Left\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\nSlideshow Left Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\nSlideshow Right Arrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Township follows DEP protocols which provide our township with suitable guidelines to design a local \\n          program that address the DEP’s six Best Management Practices (BMPs), which are also known as “control measures.”\\nThe six BMPs are designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from MS4s, to the maximum extent practicable, \\n          to protect water quality, and to satisfy the appropriate requirements of the federal Clean Water Act. These six \\n          BMP categories are:\\n\\nPublic Education &amp; Outreach Control Measure\\nPublic Participation &amp; Involvement Control Measure\\nIllicit Discharge Detection &amp; Elimination Control Measure \\nConstruction Site Stormwater Runoff Control Measure \\nPost Construction Stormwater Management in New Development &amp; Redevelopment Control Measure \\nPollution Prevention and Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and Maintenance Control Measure.\\n\\nIf anyone is seeking information or has issues regarding stormwater, please contact either:\\n\\n\\n            Christopher W.

The Act requires counties\\n          to prepare and adopt watershed based stormwater management plans—and requires municipalities to adopt\\n          and implement ordinances to regulate development consistent with these plans. The DEP provides technical,\\n          administrative and financial assistance to counties in preparing Stormwater Management Plans and pays\\n          for 75% of the costs counties incur in preparing plans. DEP also approves reimbursements to municipalities\\n          for 75% of the allowable costs of preparing plans and for enacting, administering, and implementing\\n          stormwater ordinances.\\n\\nKeeping Pool Water from Damaging Streams\\n\\nAs part of regular pool maintenance, residents and pool managers need to be aware of\\n          ways to minimize the hazardous impact pool water, which contains chemicals, has on the environment.\\n\\nLeave water in pool for at least one week, without chlorinating, prior to draining.\\nDrain pool only when test kit indicates no detectable chlorine levels and a pH level of 6.5 – 7.8.\\nIf your pool contains algae or a black film of organic matter, collect and flush it down the toilet.\\nPump pool water slowly out over a grassy area, so it can soak in. Avoid drainage paths that may spill\\n            water onto a neighbor’s property.\\nNever drain pool water directly into a stream, pond, storm drain, or other body of water.\\nProperly store pool chemicals to prevent leaks or spills. In addition, follow the instruction label\\n            for proper disposal.\\n\\nBy following these simple steps, you help ensure that your pool will not only provide\\n          months of summer fun, but also reduce the number of pollutants it could add to our precious natural\\n          water supplies.\\nAny questions, please contact your municipality.\\n\\nStormwater Education\\nUseful materials on stormwater.

As the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces such as paved streets, parking lots, and building rooftops it accumulates debris, chemicals, sediment or other pollutants that can adversely affect water quality. The primary method to control stormwater discharges is the use of best management practices (BMPs). \\n\\nWhy is Stormwater Management Important?\\n\\nUnlike water that enters our municipal sewage system, stormwater is not cleaned and treated at a wastewater plant before it re-enters our streams and waterways. Stormwater runoff from roads and other impervious areas comes into contact with pollutants and allows those pollutants into our waters. It is essential that municipalities put in place a focused Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) to combat polluted stormwater runoff.\\n\\nPolluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s), from which it is often discharged untreated into local waterbodies. To help to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped into an MS4, operators must obtain a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit through the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and develop a stormwater management program.\\n\\nMS4...� What�s�That?\\n\\nA Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) is any municipal-owned stormwater conveyance or system of conveyances. i.e. Township roads, ditches/swales, and stormwater pipes.� East Brandywine Township has to comply with the NPDES MS4 permit through 6 Minimum Control Measures (MCMs):\\n\\nMCM #1�Public Education &amp; Outreach - East Brandywine Township has made efforts to educate the public about the Stormwater Management Program through several methods, including: the Township website, the Township newsletter, Mile Marker, and the partnership with the Brandywine Valley Association (BVA).\\n\\nMCM #2�Public Involvement/Participation - East Brandywine Township encourages the public to participate in the stormwater management program decision-making process and routinely communicates with the BVA. The Township�s MS4 Annual Reports are available to the public for review by request. \\n\\nMCM #3�Illicit Discharge Detection &amp; Elimination - East Brandywine Township maps all of its stormwater features, including: outfalls, surface waters, roads, inlets, pipes, basins, etc. Illicit discharges to the MS4 are prohibited in East Brandywine Township. Outfalls are inspected regularly to verify that there are no illicit discharges and to take the appropriate actions if an illicit discharge is discovered. Examples of illicit discharges include: substances (such as used motor oil, etc.) that have been dumped into a storm sewer or waterbody, wastewater piped directly from a home to the storm sewer, failing septic systems, etc. \\n\\nMCM #4�Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control - East Brandywine Township and the Chester County Conservation District (CCCD) ensure that construction sites have adequate Erosion and Sedimentation (E&amp;S) Control Best Management Practices (BMPs) and maintain them throughout the duration of the project to prevent accelerated erosion and sedimentation to the MS4.\\n\\nMCM #5�Post Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and Re-Development - East Brandywine Township and the CCCD ensure adequate Post Construction Stormwater Management (PCSM) BMPs are proposed and installed properly. Once construction of these BMPs is complete, East Brandywine Township regularly inspects the PCSM facilities to ensure that they are functioning properly. \\n\\nMCM #6�Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping � East Brandywine Township has identified all Township-owned facilities and activities (fleet vehicle maintenance, winter de-icing, etc.) that have a potential to impact stormwater and developed an Operations and Maintenance Program to prevent stormwater pollution. Township employees are regularly trained in all aspects of the Stormwater Management Program.\\n\\nWhat is East Brandywine Township Required to Do?\\n\\nThe stormwater requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) are administered under the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and implemented by DEP through the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) Program. Almost all municipalities (including East Brandywine) in Pennsylvania must have an MS4 permit.\\n\\nEast Brandywine Township must comply with its MS4 permit through a robust stormwater management program. For more information on the MS4 program go to DEP�s MS4 Resource Page. In order to improve stream and waterway quality, federal regulations establishes Minimum Control Measures (MCMs) that must be implemented through the MS4 program. \\n\\nThe six regulations are:\\n\\n\\n Public Education and Outreach\\nPublic Participation and Involvement\\nIllicit Discharge Detection and Elimination\\nConstruction Site Runoff Control\\nPost-Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and Redevelopment\\nPollution Prevention and Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and Maintenance\\n\\nMunicipalities meet these MCM requirements through a series of Best Management Practices (BMPs) which are schedules of activities, prohibition of practices, structural controls, design criteria, maintenance procedures, and other management practices that reduce pollution to the waters of the Commonwealth.\\n\\nFor more information on MCMs and BMPs please go to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) MS4 Page where Minimum Control Measures along with the respective Best Management Practices are listed and explained.\\n\\nHow Can You Help?\\n\\nStart by creating stormwater-friendly lawns and gardens! When the amount of rain falling exceeds the land�s ability to absorb it, the result is stormwater runoff. Without treatment, stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment. Runoff can carry chemicals, metals, bacteria, viruses, organic compounds, and other pollutants directly into creeks, lakes, rivers, and streams. Runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding � even during a typical Pennsylvania storm.\\n\\nClearly, then, what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water. That means everyone, not just government, plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries. This summer, homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens and lawns are �stormwater-friendly.� \\n\\nThere are many ways you can protect water quality by preventing stormwater pollution including:\\n\\n\\n Never dump anything in storm drains, streams, wetlands, or lakes.\\nClean up pet waste.\\nReduce the use of herbicide, pesticide and fertilizer.\\nRe-vegetate bare spots in your yard to reduce erosion.\\nReport illicit discharges to East Brandywine Township.\\nHave your septic tank pumped and inspected regularly.\\nCheck your car for leaks and recycle your motor oil.\\n Properly dispose of yard waste.\\n\\nThe Stormwater-Friendly Garden\\n \\nHome gardens can contribute considerable nutrients and other pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly. This mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticides.\\n\\nFertilizers: Instead of using chemical fertilizers, give organic alternatives, such as compost and manure, a try. Compost, a �do-it-yourself� fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings, contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow. When using organic fertilizers, be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoff.\\n\\nPesticides: Many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem. If one is posing a problem, however, identify the exact pest you have and research the non-chemical alternatives to controlling it. Pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater, possibly contaminate drinking supplies, and hurt downstream ecosystems.\\n\\nThe Stormwater-Friendly Lawn\\n\\nThe following lawn-care steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners:\\n\\n\\n Set your mower height to 3 inches or higher. Taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system, which absorbs more water and prevents erosion. Deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them.\\n Keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property. A mulch-mower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn. The clippings decompose quickly, provide important nutrients for your lawn, and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration. Using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers. If mulching with your clippings is not possible, bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material that�s created as a fertilizer later.\\n Figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn. Foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems. However, if your lawn is thin or has bare spots, you may not have a choice since a dense, vegetated cover is the most stormwater-friendly lawn. There are no one-size-fits-all guidelines when it comes to fertilizer. Homeowners� needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and pH and nutrient levels. In fact, soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from �micronutrient deficiency,� a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate. Identifying your lawn�s needs first will reduce unnecessary applications, create a healthier lawn faster, and reduce your long-term costs.\\n If fertilizer is needed, maximize the benefits of slow-release nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications. Typically called �water insoluble nitrogen,� or WIN, on fertilizer bags, slow-release nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation. This type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring, instead of the fall, to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season. Another tip: Homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in March to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after October. Fertilizing during a lawn�s dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active.\\n Do not fertilize or use pesticides within 15 to 20 feet of a stream. Keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways. Also, if you live near a stream, consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead. To learn more about these buffers, visit www.stormwater.allianceforthebay.org and click on �Structural BMPs.� Also, when you�re done applying fertilizer, immediately sweep any granulated chemicals off hard surfaces and back onto your lawn. Your walkway, driveway, patio, or local road is often a quick route to the drainage pipes that discharge into local streams.\\n\\nIn the long run, little actions, such as taking a stormwater-friendly approach to your garden and lawn, will have a big impact as all of them work together to protect our water�s quality.\\n\\nWhat is a watershed?\\n\\nA watershed is the area of land that captures rain and snow, then stores, filters, seeps, or drains this water into a common waterbody (marsh, stream, river or lake). A watershed includes the network of streams that drains that surface land area and the groundwater and aquifers located underground that contribute water to those streams.\\n\\nEast Brandywine Township has three main subwatersheds: Beaver Creek, Culbertson Run, and East Branch Brandywine Creek. Both Beaver Creek and Culbertson Run drain into East Branch Brandywine Creek. East Branch Brandywine flows into Brandywine Creek, which is part of the larger Christina River Basin, and ultimately the Delaware Bay. \\n\\nLinks\\n\\n\\n Chester County Water Resources Authority � Stormwater Management\\n Chester County Water Resources Authority � Christina Basin TMDL &amp; Implementation Plan\\n Chester County Conservation District\\n DEP - Municipal Stormwater\\n EPA - Municipal Stormwater\\n EPA - MS4 Fact Sheets\\n Brandywine Valley Association (BVA) Homepage\\n Pennsylvania Environmental Council � Water Resources Information\\nWater Resources Education Network (WREN) � Stormwater Information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStormwater Management\\n\\n\\nSnow Removal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1214 Horseshoe Pike\\n|\\nDowningtown, PA 19335\\n|\\nPh: 610-269-8230\\nAdministration Offices Open Monday through Friday��9:00 AM to 5:00 PM�\\nHome\\n|\\nContact Us\\n|\\nAccessibility\\n|\\nSite Map\\n|\\nCopyright Notices\\n|\\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArrow Left\\n\\n\\n\\nArrow Right\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[]\\n\\n\\n\\nSlideshow Left Arrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlideshow Right Arrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

It also works with the Board of Supervisors and township administration to develop procedures to maintain and acquire open space.\\nIn November 2002, East Brandywine voters, by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, approved a referendum to increase the Earned Income Tax by one-eighth of 1% to finance the preservation of open space within the township. Based on this dedicated funding source, the township supervisors floated a bond issue in 2003 that included $3 million dedicated for open space preservation expenditures.\\nIn 2004, after months of negotiation, the first payoff from the voter-approved plan to preserve open space became a reality. Using grants from the Chester County Preservation Partnership program totaling approximately half of the purchase price and Open Space Funds, the township purchased the conservation easement on 39 acres of fields and woods fronting Dowlin Forge and Rock Raymond Roads. As part of the deal, the township also purchased a nearby two-acre lot on Dowlin Forge Road for future trail access and a small park.� Since then, the Township has acquired 7 more property easements and 2 additional fee simple properties. The total land preserved through the Open Space Program is over 200 acres.� State and county grants have covered almost half of the cost of preserving this land.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent ActivitiesBecause of the sensitivity of its discussions with landowners, most of the Open Space Committee's deliberations take place in executive session. As a result, there has been little publicity about its work. �The committee is always interested in considering proposals from residents who wish to preserve their land. �Please contact Township Staff at (610) 269-8230 so they may direct your inquiry to the Committee.Open Space Committee representatives also attend township Planning Commission meetings to provide feedback on new development proposals, and encourage adoption of open space-friendly ordinances that allow development to the same density, but promote more creative use of a property to preserve open space elements such as the view shed. �In 2010 the Growing Greener Ordinance was passed. �It was based on the Natural Lands Trust Growing Greener Model Ordinance.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProtected Lands Map\\n\\n \\nClick to Download PDF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBondsville Mill Park Committee\\n\\n\\nHistorical Commission\\n\\n\\nMunicipal (Sewer) Authority\\n\\n\\nOpen Space Committee\\n\\n\\nParks &amp; Recreation Board\\n\\n\\nPlanning Commission\\n\\n\\nTrails Committee\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommittee Links\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChester County Open Space Program\\n\\n\\n\\nChester County Landscapes 2 Program\\n\\n\\n\\nBrandywine Conservancy Environmental Management Center\\n\\n\\n\\nNatural Lands Trust\\n\\n\\n\\nTrust for Public Land\\n\\n\\n\\nHeritage Conservancy\\n\\n\\n\\nSustainable Communities Network\\n\\n\\n\\nLincoln Institute of Land Policy\\n\\n\\n\\nCenter of Excellence for Sustainable Development\\n\\n\\n\\nPA Environmental Council\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView All\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n/QuickLinks.aspx\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMembers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair�Alan YefkoVice-Chair�VacantSecretary�Louise WalkerJay FischerEdward HustonMark Smith\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1214 Horseshoe Pike\\n|\\nDowningtown, PA 19335\\n|\\nPh: 610-269-8230\\nAdministration Offices Open Monday through Friday��9:00 AM to 5:00 PM�\\nHome\\n|\\nContact Us\\n|\\nAccessibility\\n|\\nSite Map\\n|\\nCopyright Notices\\n|\\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArrow Left\\n\\n\\n\\nArrow Right\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[]\\n\\n\\n\\nSlideshow Left Arrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlideshow Right Arrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

As the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces such as paved streets, parking lots, and building rooftops it accumulates debris, chemicals, sediment or other pollutants that can adversely affect water quality. The primary method to control stormwater discharges is the use of best management practices (BMPs). \\n\\nWhy is Stormwater Management Important?\\n\\nUnlike water that enters our municipal sewage system, stormwater is not cleaned and treated at a wastewater plant before it re-enters our streams and waterways. Stormwater runoff from roads and other impervious areas comes into contact with pollutants and allows those pollutants into our waters. It is essential that municipalities put in place a focused Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) to combat polluted stormwater runoff.\\n\\nPolluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s), from which it is often discharged untreated into local waterbodies. To help to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped into an MS4, operators must obtain a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit through the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and develop a stormwater management program.\\n\\nMS4...� What�s�That?\\n\\nA Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) is any municipal-owned stormwater conveyance or system of conveyances. i.e. Township roads, ditches/swales, and stormwater pipes.� East Brandywine Township has to comply with the NPDES MS4 permit through 6 Minimum Control Measures (MCMs):\\n\\nMCM #1�Public Education &amp; Outreach - East Brandywine Township has made efforts to educate the public about the Stormwater Management Program through several methods, including: the Township website, the Township newsletter, Mile Marker, and the partnership with the Brandywine Valley Association (BVA).\\n\\nMCM #2�Public Involvement/Participation - East Brandywine Township encourages the public to participate in the stormwater management program decision-making process and routinely communicates with the BVA. The Township�s MS4 Annual Reports are available to the public for review by request. \\n\\nMCM #3�Illicit Discharge Detection &amp; Elimination - East Brandywine Township maps all of its stormwater features, including: outfalls, surface waters, roads, inlets, pipes, basins, etc. Illicit discharges to the MS4 are prohibited in East Brandywine Township. Outfalls are inspected regularly to verify that there are no illicit discharges and to take the appropriate actions if an illicit discharge is discovered. Examples of illicit discharges include: substances (such as used motor oil, etc.) that have been dumped into a storm sewer or waterbody, wastewater piped directly from a home to the storm sewer, failing septic systems, etc. \\n\\nMCM #4�Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control - East Brandywine Township and the Chester County Conservation District (CCCD) ensure that construction sites have adequate Erosion and Sedimentation (E&amp;S) Control Best Management Practices (BMPs) and maintain them throughout the duration of the project to prevent accelerated erosion and sedimentation to the MS4.\\n\\nMCM #5�Post Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and Re-Development - East Brandywine Township and the CCCD ensure adequate Post Construction Stormwater Management (PCSM) BMPs are proposed and installed properly. Once construction of these BMPs is complete, East Brandywine Township regularly inspects the PCSM facilities to ensure that they are functioning properly. \\n\\nMCM #6�Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping � East Brandywine Township has identified all Township-owned facilities and activities (fleet vehicle maintenance, winter de-icing, etc.) that have a potential to impact stormwater and developed an Operations and Maintenance Program to prevent stormwater pollution. Township employees are regularly trained in all aspects of the Stormwater Management Program.\\n\\nWhat is East Brandywine Township Required to Do?\\n\\nThe stormwater requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) are administered under the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and implemented by DEP through the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) Program. Almost all municipalities (including East Brandywine) in Pennsylvania must have an MS4 permit.\\n\\nEast Brandywine Township must comply with its MS4 permit through a robust stormwater management program. For more information on the MS4 program go to DEP�s MS4 Resource Page. In order to improve stream and waterway quality, federal regulations establishes Minimum Control Measures (MCMs) that must be implemented through the MS4 program. \\n\\nThe six regulations are:\\n\\n\\n Public Education and Outreach\\nPublic Participation and Involvement\\nIllicit Discharge Detection and Elimination\\nConstruction Site Runoff Control\\nPost-Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and Redevelopment\\nPollution Prevention and Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and Maintenance\\n\\nMunicipalities meet these MCM requirements through a series of Best Management Practices (BMPs) which are schedules of activities, prohibition of practices, structural controls, design criteria, maintenance procedures, and other management practices that reduce pollution to the waters of the Commonwealth.\\n\\nFor more information on MCMs and BMPs please go to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) MS4 Page where Minimum Control Measures along with the respective Best Management Practices are listed and explained.\\n\\nHow Can You Help?\\n\\nStart by creating stormwater-friendly lawns and gardens! When the amount of rain falling exceeds the land�s ability to absorb it, the result is stormwater runoff. Without treatment, stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment. Runoff can carry chemicals, metals, bacteria, viruses, organic compounds, and other pollutants directly into creeks, lakes, rivers, and streams. Runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding � even during a typical Pennsylvania storm.\\n\\nClearly, then, what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water. That means everyone, not just government, plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries. This summer, homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens and lawns are �stormwater-friendly.� \\n\\nThere are many ways you can protect water quality by preventing stormwater pollution including:\\n\\n\\n Never dump anything in storm drains, streams, wetlands, or lakes.\\nClean up pet waste.\\nReduce the use of herbicide, pesticide and fertilizer.\\nRe-vegetate bare spots in your yard to reduce erosion.\\nReport illicit discharges to East Brandywine Township.\\nHave your septic tank pumped and inspected regularly.\\nCheck your car for leaks and recycle your motor oil.\\n Properly dispose of yard waste.\\n\\nThe Stormwater-Friendly Garden\\n \\nHome gardens can contribute considerable nutrients and other pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly. This mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticides.\\n\\nFertilizers: Instead of using chemical fertilizers, give organic alternatives, such as compost and manure, a try. Compost, a �do-it-yourself� fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings, contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow. When using organic fertilizers, be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoff.\\n\\nPesticides: Many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem. If one is posing a problem, however, identify the exact pest you have and research the non-chemical alternatives to controlling it. Pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater, possibly contaminate drinking supplies, and hurt downstream ecosystems.\\n\\nThe Stormwater-Friendly Lawn\\n\\nThe following lawn-care steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners:\\n\\n\\n Set your mower height to 3 inches or higher. Taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system, which absorbs more water and prevents erosion. Deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them.\\n Keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property. A mulch-mower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn. The clippings decompose quickly, provide important nutrients for your lawn, and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration. Using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers. If mulching with your clippings is not possible, bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material that�s created as a fertilizer later.\\n Figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn. Foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems. However, if your lawn is thin or has bare spots, you may not have a choice since a dense, vegetated cover is the most stormwater-friendly lawn. There are no one-size-fits-all guidelines when it comes to fertilizer. Homeowners� needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and pH and nutrient levels. In fact, soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from �micronutrient deficiency,� a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate. Identifying your lawn�s needs first will reduce unnecessary applications, create a healthier lawn faster, and reduce your long-term costs.\\n If fertilizer is needed, maximize the benefits of slow-release nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications. Typically called �water insoluble nitrogen,� or WIN, on fertilizer bags, slow-release nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation. This type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring, instead of the fall, to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season. Another tip: Homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in March to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after October. Fertilizing during a lawn�s dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active.\\n Do not fertilize or use pesticides within 15 to 20 feet of a stream. Keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways. Also, if you live near a stream, consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead. To learn more about these buffers, visit www.stormwater.allianceforthebay.org and click on �Structural BMPs.� Also, when you�re done applying fertilizer, immediately sweep any granulated chemicals off hard surfaces and back onto your lawn. Your walkway, driveway, patio, or local road is often a quick route to the drainage pipes that discharge into local streams.\\n\\nIn the long run, little actions, such as taking a stormwater-friendly approach to your garden and lawn, will have a big impact as all of them work together to protect our water�s quality.\\n\\nWhat is a watershed?\\n\\nA watershed is the area of land that captures rain and snow, then stores, filters, seeps, or drains this water into a common waterbody (marsh, stream, river or lake). A watershed includes the network of streams that drains that surface land area and the groundwater and aquifers located underground that contribute water to those streams.\\n\\nEast Brandywine Township has three main subwatersheds: Beaver Creek, Culbertson Run, and East Branch Brandywine Creek. Both Beaver Creek and Culbertson Run drain into East Branch Brandywine Creek. East Branch Brandywine flows into Brandywine Creek, which is part of the larger Christina River Basin, and ultimately the Delaware Bay. \\n\\nLinks\\n\\n\\n Chester County Water Resources Authority � Stormwater Management\\n Chester County Water Resources Authority � Christina Basin TMDL &amp; Implementation Plan\\n Chester County Conservation District\\n DEP - Municipal Stormwater\\n EPA - Municipal Stormwater\\n EPA - MS4 Fact Sheets\\n Brandywine Valley Association (BVA) Homepage\\n Pennsylvania Environmental Council � Water Resources Information\\nWater Resources Education Network (WREN) � Stormwater Information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStormwater Management\\n\\n\\nSnow Removal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1214 Horseshoe Pike\\n|\\nDowningtown, PA 19335\\n|\\nPh: 610-269-8230\\nAdministration Offices Open Monday through Friday��9:00 AM to 5:00 PM�\\nHome\\n|\\nContact Us\\n|\\nAccessibility\\n|\\nSite Map\\n|\\nCopyright Notices\\n|\\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArrow Left\\n\\n\\n\\nArrow Right\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[]\\n\\n\\n\\nSlideshow Left Arrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlideshow Right Arrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Township</td>\n      <td>East Brandywine</td>\n      <td>Chester</td>\n      <td>Pennsylvania</td>\n      <td>Open Space</td>\n      <td>Open Space Program</td>\n      <td>Open Space Committee | East Brandywine, PA - Official Website</td>\n      <td>https://www.ebrandywine.org/135/Open-Space-Committee</td>\n      <td>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen Space Committee | East Brandywine, PA - Official Website\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to Main Content\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLoading\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Loading\\n            \\n\\n\\nDo Not Show Again\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a Website Account - Manage notification subscriptions, save form progress and more. ��\\n\\nWebsite Sign In\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nPinterest\\nDelicious\\nBlogger\\nLinkedIn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHome\\nMy Account\\nPrinter Friendly\\nEmail Page\\nContact Us\\nHear This Page\\nRSS\\nSite Map\\nTranslate Page\\nNotifications\\nDocuments\\nHelp\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHomeGovernmentServicesOur Township\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\nHomeGovernmentBoards, Committees &amp; CommissionsOpen Space Committee\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen Space Committee\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommittee History\\n The Open Space Committee was created by the Board of Supervisors in 2002, with the charter to help identify potential open-space properties and explain the conservation options to those property owners. It also works with the Board of Supervisors and township administration to develop procedures to maintain and acquire open space.\\nIn November 2002, East Brandywine voters, by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, approved a referendum to increase the Earned Income Tax by one-eighth of 1% to finance the preservation of open space within the township. Based on this dedicated funding source, the township supervisors floated a bond issue in 2003 that included $3 million dedicated for open space preservation expenditures.\\nIn 2004, after months of negotiation, the first payoff from the voter-approved plan to preserve open space became a reality. Using grants from the Chester County Preservation Partnership program totaling approximately half of the purchase price and Open Space Funds, the township purchased the conservation easement on 39 acres of fields and woods fronting Dowlin Forge and Rock Raymond Roads. As part of the deal, the township also purchased a nearby two-acre lot on Dowlin Forge Road for future trail access and a small park.� Since then, the Township has acquired 7 more property easements and 2 additional fee simple properties. The total land preserved through the Open Space Program is over 200 acres.� State and county grants have covered almost half of the cost of preserving this land.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent ActivitiesBecause of the sensitivity of its discussions with landowners, most of the Open Space Committee's deliberations take place in executive session. As a result, there has been little publicity about its work. �The committee is always interested in considering proposals from residents who wish to preserve their land. �Please contact Township Staff at (610) 269-8230 so they may direct your inquiry to the Committee.Open Space Committee representatives also attend township Planning Commission meetings to provide feedback on new development proposals, and encourage adoption of open space-friendly ordinances that allow development to the same density, but promote more creative use of a property to preserve open space elements such as the view shed. �In 2010 the Growing Greener Ordinance was passed. �It was based on the Natural Lands Trust Growing Greener Model Ordinance.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProtected Lands Map\\n\\n \\nClick to Download PDF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBondsville Mill Park Committee\\n\\n\\nHistorical Commission\\n\\n\\nMunicipal (Sewer) Authority\\n\\n\\nOpen Space Committee\\n\\n\\nParks &amp; Recreation Board\\n\\n\\nPlanning Commission\\n\\n\\nTrails Committee\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommittee Links\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChester County Open Space Program\\n\\n\\n\\nChester County Landscapes 2 Program\\n\\n\\n\\nBrandywine Conservancy Environmental Management Center\\n\\n\\n\\nNatural Lands Trust\\n\\n\\n\\nTrust for Public Land\\n\\n\\n\\nHeritage Conservancy\\n\\n\\n\\nSustainable Communities Network\\n\\n\\n\\nLincoln Institute of Land Policy\\n\\n\\n\\nCenter of Excellence for Sustainable Development\\n\\n\\n\\nPA Environmental Council\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView All\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n/QuickLinks.aspx\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMembers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChair�Alan YefkoVice-Chair�VacantSecretary�Louise WalkerJay FischerEdward HustonMark Smith\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1214 Horseshoe Pike\\n|\\nDowningtown, PA 19335\\n|\\nPh: 610-269-8230\\nAdministration Offices Open Monday through Friday��9:00 AM to 5:00 PM�\\nHome\\n|\\nContact Us\\n|\\nAccessibility\\n|\\nSite Map\\n|\\nCopyright Notices\\n|\\nGovernment Websites by CivicPlus�\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArrow Left\\n\\n\\n\\nArrow Right\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[]\\n\\n\\n\\nSlideshow Left Arrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlideshow Right Arrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>",

       "      <td>Charlestown Township - Stormwater ManagementChester County, PennsylvaniaStormwater ManagementStormwater ManagementMS4 ProgramIn 2003, Charlestown Township was designated a Small Municipal Storm Sewer System (MS4) under the Pennsylvania           Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General           Permit regulations.These state regulations require Charlestown Township to implement and enforce its own Stormwater Management           Program. The Township follows DEP protocols which provide our township with suitable guidelines to design a local           program that address the DEP’s six Best Management Practices (BMPs), which are also known as “control measures.”The six BMPs are designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from MS4s, to the maximum extent practicable,           to protect water quality, and to satisfy the appropriate requirements of the federal Clean Water Act. These six           BMP categories are:Public Education &amp; Outreach Control MeasurePublic Participation &amp; Involvement Control MeasureIllicit Discharge Detection &amp; Elimination Control Measure Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control Measure Post Construction Stormwater Management in New Development &amp; Redevelopment Control Measure Pollution Prevention and Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and Maintenance Control Measure.If anyone is seeking information or has issues regarding stormwater, please contact either:            Christopher W. Heleniak, Township Manager, (610) 240-0326            Daniel T. Wright, P.E., Township Engineer, 610) 840-9100Please visit the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Stormwater Management Program Website          www.dep.state.pa.us, go to directLINK “stormwater” for           additional details and technical information on this topic at the state level.Act 167In response to the impacts of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from land development,          in 1978, the state enacted Pennsylvania’s Stormwater Management Act (Act 167). The Act requires counties          to prepare and adopt watershed based stormwater management plans—and requires municipalities to adopt          and implement ordinances to regulate development consistent with these plans. The DEP provides technical,          administrative and financial assistance to counties in preparing Stormwater Management Plans and pays          for 75% of the costs counties incur in preparing plans. DEP also approves reimbursements to municipalities          for 75% of the allowable costs of preparing plans and for enacting, administering, and implementing          stormwater ordinances.Keeping Pool Water from Damaging StreamsAs part of regular pool maintenance, residents and pool managers need to be aware of          ways to minimize the hazardous impact pool water, which contains chemicals, has on the environment.Leave water in pool for at least one week, without chlorinating, prior to draining.Drain pool only when test kit indicates no detectable chlorine levels and a pH level of 6.5 – 7.8.If your pool contains algae or a black film of organic matter, collect and flush it down the toilet.Pump pool water slowly out over a grassy area, so it can soak in. Avoid drainage paths that may spill            water onto a neighbor’s property.Never drain pool water directly into a stream, pond, storm drain, or other body of water.Properly store pool chemicals to prevent leaks or spills. In addition, follow the instruction label            for proper disposal.By following these simple steps, you help ensure that your pool will not only provide          months of summer fun, but also reduce the number of pollutants it could add to our precious natural          water supplies.Any questions, please contact your municipality.Stormwater EducationUseful materials on stormwater.

As the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces such as paved streets, parking lots, and building rooftops it accumulates debris, chemicals, sediment or other pollutants that can adversely affect water quality. The primary method to control stormwater discharges is the use of best management practices (BMPs). Why is Stormwater Management Important?Unlike water that enters our municipal sewage system, stormwater is not cleaned and treated at a wastewater plant before it re-enters our streams and waterways. Stormwater runoff from roads and other impervious areas comes into contact with pollutants and allows those pollutants into our waters. It is essential that municipalities put in place a focused Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) to combat polluted stormwater runoff.Polluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s), from which it is often discharged untreated into local waterbodies. To help to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped into an MS4, operators must obtain a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit through the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and develop a stormwater management program.MS4...� What�s�That?A Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) is any municipal-owned stormwater conveyance or system of conveyances. i.e. Township roads, ditches/swales, and stormwater pipes.� East Brandywine Township has to comply with the NPDES MS4 permit through 6 Minimum Control Measures (MCMs):MCM #1�Public Education &amp; Outreach - East Brandywine Township has made efforts to educate the public about the Stormwater Management Program through several methods, including: the Township website, the Township newsletter, Mile Marker, and the partnership with the Brandywine Valley Association (BVA).MCM #2�Public Involvement/Participation - East Brandywine Township encourages the public to participate in the stormwater management program decision-making process and routinely communicates with the BVA. The Township�s MS4 Annual Reports are available to the public for review by request. MCM #3�Illicit Discharge Detection &amp; Elimination - East Brandywine Township maps all of its stormwater features, including: outfalls, surface waters, roads, inlets, pipes, basins, etc. Illicit discharges to the MS4 are prohibited in East Brandywine Township. Outfalls are inspected regularly to verify that there are no illicit discharges and to take the appropriate actions if an illicit discharge is discovered. Examples of illicit discharges include: substances (such as used motor oil, etc.) that have been dumped into a storm sewer or waterbody, wastewater piped directly from a home to the storm sewer, failing septic systems, etc. MCM #4�Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control - East Brandywine Township and the Chester County Conservation District (CCCD) ensure that construction sites have adequate Erosion and Sedimentation (E&amp;S) Control Best Management Practices (BMPs) and maintain them throughout the duration of the project to prevent accelerated erosion and sedimentation to the MS4.MCM #5�Post Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and Re-Development - East Brandywine Township and the CCCD ensure adequate Post Construction Stormwater Management (PCSM) BMPs are proposed and installed properly. Once construction of these BMPs is complete, East Brandywine Township regularly inspects the PCSM facilities to ensure that they are functioning properly. MCM #6�Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping � East Brandywine Township has identified all Township-owned facilities and activities (fleet vehicle maintenance, winter de-icing, etc.) that have a potential to impact stormwater and developed an Operations and Maintenance Program to prevent stormwater pollution. Township employees are regularly trained in all aspects of the Stormwater Management Program.What is East Brandywine Township Required to Do?The stormwater requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) are administered under the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and implemented by DEP through the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) Program. Almost all municipalities (including East Brandywine) in Pennsylvania must have an MS4 permit.East Brandywine Township must comply with its MS4 permit through a robust stormwater management program. For more information on the MS4 program go to DEP�s MS4 Resource Page. In order to improve stream and waterway quality, federal regulations establishes Minimum Control Measures (MCMs) that must be implemented through the MS4 program. The six regulations are: Public Education and OutreachPublic Participation and InvolvementIllicit Discharge Detection and EliminationConstruction Site Runoff ControlPost-Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and RedevelopmentPollution Prevention and Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and MaintenanceMunicipalities meet these MCM requirements through a series of Best Management Practices (BMPs) which are schedules of activities, prohibition of practices, structural controls, design criteria, maintenance procedures, and other management practices that reduce pollution to the waters of the Commonwealth.For more information on MCMs and BMPs please go to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) MS4 Page where Minimum Control Measures along with the respective Best Management Practices are listed and explained.How Can You Help?Start by creating stormwater-friendly lawns and gardens! When the amount of rain falling exceeds the land�s ability to absorb it, the result is stormwater runoff. Without treatment, stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment. Runoff can carry chemicals, metals, bacteria, viruses, organic compounds, and other pollutants directly into creeks, lakes, rivers, and streams. Runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding � even during a typical Pennsylvania storm.Clearly, then, what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water. That means everyone, not just government, plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries. This summer, homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens and lawns are �stormwater-friendly.� There are many ways you can protect water quality by preventing stormwater pollution including: Never dump anything in storm drains, streams, wetlands, or lakes.Clean up pet waste.Reduce the use of herbicide, pesticide and fertilizer.Re-vegetate bare spots in your yard to reduce erosion.Report illicit discharges to East Brandywine Township.Have your septic tank pumped and inspected regularly.Check your car for leaks and recycle your motor oil. Properly dispose of yard waste.The Stormwater-Friendly Garden Home gardens can contribute considerable nutrients and other pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly. This mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticides.Fertilizers: Instead of using chemical fertilizers, give organic alternatives, such as compost and manure, a try. Compost, a �do-it-yourself� fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings, contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow. When using organic fertilizers, be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoff.Pesticides: Many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem. If one is posing a problem, however, identify the exact pest you have and research the non-chemical alternatives to controlling it. Pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater, possibly contaminate drinking supplies, and hurt downstream ecosystems.The Stormwater-Friendly LawnThe following lawn-care steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners: Set your mower height to 3 inches or higher. Taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system, which absorbs more water and prevents erosion. Deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them. Keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property. A mulch-mower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn. The clippings decompose quickly, provide important nutrients for your lawn, and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration. Using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers. If mulching with your clippings is not possible, bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material that�s created as a fertilizer later. Figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn. Foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems. However, if your lawn is thin or has bare spots, you may not have a choice since a dense, vegetated cover is the most stormwater-friendly lawn. There are no one-size-fits-all guidelines when it comes to fertilizer. Homeowners� needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and pH and nutrient levels. In fact, soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from �micronutrient deficiency,� a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate. Identifying your lawn�s needs first will reduce unnecessary applications, create a healthier lawn faster, and reduce your long-term costs. If fertilizer is needed, maximize the benefits of slow-release nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications. Typically called �water insoluble nitrogen,� or WIN, on fertilizer bags, slow-release nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation. This type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring, instead of the fall, to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season. Another tip: Homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in March to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after October. Fertilizing during a lawn�s dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active. Do not fertilize or use pesticides within 15 to 20 feet of a stream. Keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways. Also, if you live near a stream, consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead. To learn more about these buffers, visit www.stormwater.allianceforthebay.org and click on �Structural BMPs.� Also, when you�re done applying fertilizer, immediately sweep any granulated chemicals off hard surfaces and back onto your lawn. Your walkway, driveway, patio, or local road is often a quick route to the drainage pipes that discharge into local streams.In the long run, little actions, such as taking a stormwater-friendly approach to your garden and lawn, will have a big impact as all of them work together to protect our water�s quality.What is a watershed?A watershed is the area of land that captures rain and snow, then stores, filters, seeps, or drains this water into a common waterbody (marsh, stream, river or lake). A watershed includes the network of streams that drains that surface land area and the groundwater and aquifers located underground that contribute water to those streams.East Brandywine Township has three main subwatersheds: Beaver Creek, Culbertson Run, and East Branch Brandywine Creek. Both Beaver Creek and Culbertson Run drain into East Branch Brandywine Creek. East Branch Brandywine flows into Brandywine Creek, which is part of the larger Christina River Basin, and ultimately the Delaware Bay.

It also works with the Board of Supervisors and township administration to develop procedures to maintain and acquire open space.In November 2002, East Brandywine voters, by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, approved a referendum to increase the Earned Income Tax by one-eighth of 1% to finance the preservation of open space within the township. Based on this dedicated funding source, the township supervisors floated a bond issue in 2003 that included $3 million dedicated for open space preservation expenditures.In 2004, after months of negotiation, the first payoff from the voter-approved plan to preserve open space became a reality. Using grants from the Chester County Preservation Partnership program totaling approximately half of the purchase price and Open Space Funds, the township purchased the conservation easement on 39 acres of fields and woods fronting Dowlin Forge and Rock Raymond Roads. As part of the deal, the township also purchased a nearby two-acre lot on Dowlin Forge Road for future trail access and a small park.� Since then, the Township has acquired 7 more property easements and 2 additional fee simple properties. The total land preserved through the Open Space Program is over 200 acres.� State and county grants have covered almost half of the cost of preserving this land.   Current ActivitiesBecause of the sensitivity of its discussions with landowners, most of the Open Space Committee's deliberations take place in executive session. As a result, there has been little publicity about its work. �The committee is always interested in considering proposals from residents who wish to preserve their land. �Please contact Township Staff at (610) 269-8230 so they may direct your inquiry to the Committee.Open Space Committee representatives also attend township Planning Commission meetings to provide feedback on new development proposals, and encourage adoption of open space-friendly ordinances that allow development to the same density, but promote more creative use of a property to preserve open space elements such as the view shed. �In 2010 the Growing Greener Ordinance was passed. �It was based on the Natural Lands Trust Growing Greener Model Ordinance.

The Township follows DEP protocols which provide our township with suitable guidelines to design a local           program that address the DEP’s six Best Management Practices (BMPs), which are also known as “control measures.”The six BMPs are designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from MS4s, to the maximum extent practicable,           to protect water quality, and to satisfy the appropriate requirements of the federal Clean Water Act. These six           BMP categories are:Public Education &amp; Outreach Control MeasurePublic Participation &amp; Involvement Control MeasureIllicit Discharge Detection &amp; Elimination Control Measure Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control Measure Post Construction Stormwater Management in New Development &amp; Redevelopment Control Measure Pollution Prevention and Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and Maintenance Control Measure.If anyone is seeking information or has issues regarding stormwater, please contact either:            Christopher W.

The Act requires counties          to prepare and adopt watershed based stormwater management plans—and requires municipalities to adopt          and implement ordinances to regulate development consistent with these plans. The DEP provides technical,          administrative and financial assistance to counties in preparing Stormwater Management Plans and pays          for 75% of the costs counties incur in preparing plans. DEP also approves reimbursements to municipalities          for 75% of the allowable costs of preparing plans and for enacting, administering, and implementing          stormwater ordinances.Keeping Pool Water from Damaging StreamsAs part of regular pool maintenance, residents and pool managers need to be aware of          ways to minimize the hazardous impact pool water, which contains chemicals, has on the environment.Leave water in pool for at least one week, without chlorinating, prior to draining.Drain pool only when test kit indicates no detectable chlorine levels and a pH level of 6.5 – 7.8.If your pool contains algae or a black film of organic matter, collect and flush it down the toilet.Pump pool water slowly out over a grassy area, so it can soak in. Avoid drainage paths that may spill            water onto a neighbor’s property.Never drain pool water directly into a stream, pond, storm drain, or other body of water.Properly store pool chemicals to prevent leaks or spills. In addition, follow the instruction label            for proper disposal.By following these simple steps, you help ensure that your pool will not only provide          months of summer fun, but also reduce the number of pollutants it could add to our precious natural          water supplies.Any questions, please contact your municipality.Stormwater EducationUseful materials on stormwater.

As the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces such as paved streets, parking lots, and building rooftops it accumulates debris, chemicals, sediment or other pollutants that can adversely affect water quality. The primary method to control stormwater discharges is the use of best management practices (BMPs). Why is Stormwater Management Important?Unlike water that enters our municipal sewage system, stormwater is not cleaned and treated at a wastewater plant before it re-enters our streams and waterways. Stormwater runoff from roads and other impervious areas comes into contact with pollutants and allows those pollutants into our waters. It is essential that municipalities put in place a focused Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) to combat polluted stormwater runoff.Polluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s), from which it is often discharged untreated into local waterbodies. To help to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped into an MS4, operators must obtain a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit through the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and develop a stormwater management program.MS4...� What�s�That?A Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) is any municipal-owned stormwater conveyance or system of conveyances. i.e. Township roads, ditches/swales, and stormwater pipes.� East Brandywine Township has to comply with the NPDES MS4 permit through 6 Minimum Control Measures (MCMs):MCM #1�Public Education &amp; Outreach - East Brandywine Township has made efforts to educate the public about the Stormwater Management Program through several methods, including: the Township website, the Township newsletter, Mile Marker, and the partnership with the Brandywine Valley Association (BVA).MCM #2�Public Involvement/Participation - East Brandywine Township encourages the public to participate in the stormwater management program decision-making process and routinely communicates with the BVA. The Township�s MS4 Annual Reports are available to the public for review by request. MCM #3�Illicit Discharge Detection &amp; Elimination - East Brandywine Township maps all of its stormwater features, including: outfalls, surface waters, roads, inlets, pipes, basins, etc. Illicit discharges to the MS4 are prohibited in East Brandywine Township. Outfalls are inspected regularly to verify that there are no illicit discharges and to take the appropriate actions if an illicit discharge is discovered. Examples of illicit discharges include: substances (such as used motor oil, etc.) that have been dumped into a storm sewer or waterbody, wastewater piped directly from a home to the storm sewer, failing septic systems, etc. MCM #4�Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control - East Brandywine Township and the Chester County Conservation District (CCCD) ensure that construction sites have adequate Erosion and Sedimentation (E&amp;S) Control Best Management Practices (BMPs) and maintain them throughout the duration of the project to prevent accelerated erosion and sedimentation to the MS4.MCM #5�Post Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and Re-Development - East Brandywine Township and the CCCD ensure adequate Post Construction Stormwater Management (PCSM) BMPs are proposed and installed properly. Once construction of these BMPs is complete, East Brandywine Township regularly inspects the PCSM facilities to ensure that they are functioning properly. MCM #6�Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping � East Brandywine Township has identified all Township-owned facilities and activities (fleet vehicle maintenance, winter de-icing, etc.) that have a potential to impact stormwater and developed an Operations and Maintenance Program to prevent stormwater pollution. Township employees are regularly trained in all aspects of the Stormwater Management Program.What is East Brandywine Township Required to Do?The stormwater requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) are administered under the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and implemented by DEP through the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) Program. Almost all municipalities (including East Brandywine) in Pennsylvania must have an MS4 permit.East Brandywine Township must comply with its MS4 permit through a robust stormwater management program. For more information on the MS4 program go to DEP�s MS4 Resource Page. In order to improve stream and waterway quality, federal regulations establishes Minimum Control Measures (MCMs) that must be implemented through the MS4 program. The six regulations are: Public Education and OutreachPublic Participation and InvolvementIllicit Discharge Detection and EliminationConstruction Site Runoff ControlPost-Construction Stormwater Management in New Development and RedevelopmentPollution Prevention and Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations and MaintenanceMunicipalities meet these MCM requirements through a series of Best Management Practices (BMPs) which are schedules of activities, prohibition of practices, structural controls, design criteria, maintenance procedures, and other management practices that reduce pollution to the waters of the Commonwealth.For more information on MCMs and BMPs please go to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) MS4 Page where Minimum Control Measures along with the respective Best Management Practices are listed and explained.How Can You Help?Start by creating stormwater-friendly lawns and gardens! When the amount of rain falling exceeds the land�s ability to absorb it, the result is stormwater runoff. Without treatment, stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment. Runoff can carry chemicals, metals, bacteria, viruses, organic compounds, and other pollutants directly into creeks, lakes, rivers, and streams. Runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding � even during a typical Pennsylvania storm.Clearly, then, what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water. That means everyone, not just government, plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries. This summer, homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens and lawns are �stormwater-friendly.� There are many ways you can protect water quality by preventing stormwater pollution including: Never dump anything in storm drains, streams, wetlands, or lakes.Clean up pet waste.Reduce the use of herbicide, pesticide and fertilizer.Re-vegetate bare spots in your yard to reduce erosion.Report illicit discharges to East Brandywine Township.Have your septic tank pumped and inspected regularly.Check your car for leaks and recycle your motor oil. Properly dispose of yard waste.The Stormwater-Friendly Garden Home gardens can contribute considerable nutrients and other pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly. This mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticides.Fertilizers: Instead of using chemical fertilizers, give organic alternatives, such as compost and manure, a try. Compost, a �do-it-yourself� fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings, contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow. When using organic fertilizers, be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoff.Pesticides: Many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem. If one is posing a problem, however, identify the exact pest you have and research the non-chemical alternatives to controlling it. Pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater, possibly contaminate drinking supplies, and hurt downstream ecosystems.The Stormwater-Friendly LawnThe following lawn-care steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners: Set your mower height to 3 inches or higher. Taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system, which absorbs more water and prevents erosion. Deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them. Keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property. A mulch-mower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn. The clippings decompose quickly, provide important nutrients for your lawn, and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration. Using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers. If mulching with your clippings is not possible, bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material that�s created as a fertilizer later. Figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn. Foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems. However, if your lawn is thin or has bare spots, you may not have a choice since a dense, vegetated cover is the most stormwater-friendly lawn. There are no one-size-fits-all guidelines when it comes to fertilizer. Homeowners� needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and pH and nutrient levels. In fact, soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from �micronutrient deficiency,� a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate. Identifying your lawn�s needs first will reduce unnecessary applications, create a healthier lawn faster, and reduce your long-term costs. If fertilizer is needed, maximize the benefits of slow-release nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications. Typically called �water insoluble nitrogen,� or WIN, on fertilizer bags, slow-release nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation. This type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring, instead of the fall, to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season. Another tip: Homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in March to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after October. Fertilizing during a lawn�s dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active. Do not fertilize or use pesticides within 15 to 20 feet of a stream. Keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways. Also, if you live near a stream, consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead. To learn more about these buffers, visit www.stormwater.allianceforthebay.org and click on �Structural BMPs.� Also, when you�re done applying fertilizer, immediately sweep any granulated chemicals off hard surfaces and back onto your lawn. Your walkway, driveway, patio, or local road is often a quick route to the drainage pipes that discharge into local streams.In the long run, little actions, such as taking a stormwater-friendly approach to your garden and lawn, will have a big impact as all of them work together to protect our water�s quality.What is a watershed?A watershed is the area of land that captures rain and snow, then stores, filters, seeps, or drains this water into a common waterbody (marsh, stream, river or lake). A watershed includes the network of streams that drains that surface land area and the groundwater and aquifers located underground that contribute water to those streams.East Brandywine Township has three main subwatersheds: Beaver Creek, Culbertson Run, and East Branch Brandywine Creek. Both Beaver Creek and Culbertson Run drain into East Branch Brandywine Creek. East Branch Brandywine flows into Brandywine Creek, which is part of the larger Christina River Basin, and ultimately the Delaware Bay.

It also works with the Board of Supervisors and township administration to develop procedures to maintain and acquire open space.In November 2002, East Brandywine voters, by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, approved a referendum to increase the Earned Income Tax by one-eighth of 1% to finance the preservation of open space within the township. Based on this dedicated funding source, the township supervisors floated a bond issue in 2003 that included $3 million dedicated for open space preservation expenditures.In 2004, after months of negotiation, the first payoff from the voter-approved plan to preserve open space became a reality. Using grants from the Chester County Preservation Partnership program totaling approximately half of the purchase price and Open Space Funds, the township purchased the conservation easement on 39 acres of fields and woods fronting Dowlin Forge and Rock Raymond Roads. As part of the deal, the township also purchased a nearby two-acre lot on Dowlin Forge Road for future trail access and a small park.� Since then, the Township has acquired 7 more property easements and 2 additional fee simple properties. The total land preserved through the Open Space Program is over 200 acres.� State and county grants have covered almost half of the cost of preserving this land.   Current ActivitiesBecause of the sensitivity of its discussions with landowners, most of the Open Space Committee's deliberations take place in executive session. As a result, there has been little publicity about its work. �The committee is always interested in considering proposals from residents who wish to preserve their land. �Please contact Township Staff at (610) 269-8230 so they may direct your inquiry to the Committee.Open Space Committee representatives also attend township Planning Commission meetings to provide feedback on new development proposals, and encourage adoption of open space-friendly ordinances that allow development to the same density, but promote more creative use of a property to preserve open space elements such as the view shed. �In 2010 the Growing Greener Ordinance was passed. �It was based on the Natural Lands Trust Growing Greener Model Ordinance.

go to the us environmental protection agency epa ms4 page where minimum control measures along with the respective best management practices are listed and explainedhow can you helpstart by creating stormwaterfriendly lawns and gardens when the amount of rain falling exceeds the lands ability to absorb it the result is stormwater runoff without treatment stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment runoff can carry chemicals metals bacteria viruses organic compounds and other pollutants directly into creeks lakes rivers and streams runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding even during a typical pennsylvania stormclearly then what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water that means everyone not just government plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries this summer homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens and lawns are stormwaterfriendly there are many ways you can protect water quality by preventing stormwater pollution including never dump anything in storm drains streams wetlands or lakesclean up

inspected regularlycheck your car for leaks and recycle your motor oil properly dispose of yard wastethe stormwaterfriendly garden home gardens can contribute considerable nutrients and other pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly this mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticidesfertilizers instead of using chemical fertilizers give organic alternatives such as compost and manure a try compost a doityourself fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow when using organic fertilizers be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoffpesticides many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem if one is posing a problem however identify the exact pest you have and research the nonchemical alternatives to controlling it pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater possibly contaminate drinking supplies and hurt downstream ecosystemsthe stormwaterfriendly lawnthe following lawncare steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners set your mower height to inches or higher taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system which absorbs more water and prevents erosion deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property a mulchmower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn the clippings decompose quickly provide important nutrients for your lawn and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers if mulching with your clippings is not possible bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material thats created as a fertilizer later figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems however if your lawn is thin or has bare spots you may not have a choice since a dense vegetated cover is the most stormwaterfriendly lawn there are no onesizefitsall guidelines when it comes to fertilizer homeowners needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and ph and nutrient levels in fact soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from micronutrient deficiency a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate identifying your lawns needs first will reduce unnecessary applications create a healthier lawn faster and reduce your longterm costs if fertilizer is needed maximize the benefits of slowrelease nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications typically called water insoluble nitrogen or win on fertilizer bags slowrelease nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation this type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring instead of the fall to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season another tip homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in march to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after october fertilizing during a lawns dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active do not fertilize or use pesticides within to feet of a stream keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways also if you live near a stream consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead to learn more about these buffers visit wwwstormwaterallianceforthebayorg and click on structural bmps also when youre done applying fertilizer immediately sweep any granulated chemicals off hard surfaces and back onto your lawn your

what is stormwaterstormwater runoff is generated when precipitation from rain and snowmelt events flows over land or impervious surfaces and does not percolate into the ground as the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces such as paved streets parking lots and building rooftops it accumulates debris chemicals sediment or other pollutants that can adversely affect water quality the primary method to control stormwater discharges is the use of best management practices bmps why is stormwater management importantunlike water that enters our municipal sewage system stormwater is not cleaned and treated at a wastewater plant before it reenters our streams and waterways stormwater runoff from roads and other impervious areas comes into contact with pollutants and allows those pollutants into our waters it is essential that municipalities put in place a focused stormwater management program swmp to combat polluted stormwater runoffpolluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4s from which it is often discharged untreated into local waterbodies to help to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped

space committee open space committee committee history the open space committee was created by the board of supervisors in with the charter to help identify potential openspace properties and explain the conservation options to those property owners it also works with the board of supervisors and township administration to develop procedures to maintain and acquire open spacein november east brandywine voters by a nearly to margin approved a referendum to increase the earned income tax by oneeighth of to finance the preservation of open space within the township based on this dedicated funding source the township supervisors floated a bond issue in that included $ million dedicated for open space preservation expendituresin after months of negotiation the first payoff from the voterapproved plan to preserve open space became a reality using grants from the chester county preservation partnership program totaling approximately half of the purchase price and open space funds the township purchased the conservation easement on acres of fields and woods fronting dowlin forge and rock raymond roads as part of the deal the township also purchased a nearby twoacre lot on dowlin forge road for future trail access and a small park since then the township has acquired more property easements and additional fee simple properties the total land preserved through the open space program is over acres state and county grants have covered almost half of the cost of preserving this land current activitiesbecause of the sensitivity of its discussions with landowners most of the open space committees deliberations take place in executive session as a result there has been little publicity about its work the committee is always interested in considering proposals from residents who wish to preserve their land please contact township staff at so they may direct your inquiry to the committeeopen space committee representatives also attend township planning commission meetings to provide feedback on new development proposals and encourage adoption of open spacefriendly ordinances that allow development to the same density but promote more creative use of a property

precipitation from rain and snowmelt events flows over land or impervious surfaces and does not percolate into the ground as the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces such as paved streets parking lots and building rooftops it accumulates debris chemicals sediment or other pollutants that can adversely affect water quality the primary method to control stormwater discharges is the use of best management practices bmps why is stormwater management importantunlike water that enters our municipal sewage system stormwater is not cleaned and treated at a wastewater plant before it reenters our streams and waterways stormwater runoff from roads and other impervious areas comes into contact with pollutants and allows those pollutants into our waters it is essential that municipalities put in place a focused stormwater management program swmp to combat polluted stormwater runoffpolluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4s from which it is often discharged untreated into local waterbodies to help to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped into an ms4 operators must obtain a national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit through the department of environmental protection dep and develop a stormwater management programms4 whatsthata municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 is

go to the us environmental protection agency epa ms4 page where minimum control measures along with the respective best management practices are listed and explainedhow can you helpstart by creating stormwaterfriendly lawns and gardens when the amount of rain falling exceeds the lands ability to absorb it the result is stormwater runoff without treatment stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment runoff can carry chemicals metals bacteria viruses organic compounds and other pollutants directly into creeks lakes rivers and streams runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding even during a typical pennsylvania stormclearly then what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water that means everyone not just government plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries this summer homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens and lawns are stormwaterfriendly there are many ways you can protect water quality by preventing stormwater pollution including never dump anything in storm drains streams wetlands or lakesclean up pet wastereduce the use of herbicide pesticide and fertilizerrevegetate bare spots in your yard to reduce erosionreport illicit discharges to east brandywine townshiphave your septic tank pumped and inspected regularlycheck your car for leaks and recycle your motor oil properly dispose of yard wastethe stormwaterfriendly garden home gardens can contribute considerable nutrients and other pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly this mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticidesfertilizers instead of using chemical fertilizers give organic alternatives such as compost and manure a try compost a doityourself fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow when using organic fertilizers be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoffpesticides many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem if one is posing a problem however identify the exact pest you have and research the nonchemical alternatives to controlling it pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater possibly contaminate drinking supplies and hurt downstream ecosystemsthe stormwaterfriendly lawnthe following lawncare steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners set your mower height to inches or higher taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system which absorbs more water and prevents erosion deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property a mulchmower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn the clippings decompose quickly provide important nutrients for your lawn and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers if mulching with your clippings is not possible bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material thats created as a fertilizer later figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems however if your lawn is thin or has bare spots you may not have a choice since a dense vegetated cover is the most stormwaterfriendly lawn there are no onesizefitsall guidelines when it comes to fertilizer homeowners needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and ph and nutrient levels in fact soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from micronutrient deficiency a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate identifying your lawns needs first will reduce unnecessary applications create a healthier lawn faster and reduce your longterm costs if fertilizer is needed maximize the benefits of slowrelease nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications typically called water insoluble nitrogen or win on fertilizer bags slowrelease nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation this type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring instead of the fall to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season another tip homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in march to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after october fertilizing during a lawns dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active do not fertilize or use pesticides within to feet of a stream keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways also if you live near a stream consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead to learn more about these buffers visit wwwstormwaterallianceforthebayorg and click on structural bmps also when youre done applying fertilizer immediately sweep any granulated chemicals off hard surfaces and back onto your lawn your walkway driveway patio or local road is often a quick route to the drainage pipes that discharge into local streamsin the long run little actions such as taking a stormwaterfriendly approach to your garden and lawn will have a big impact as all of them work together to protect our waters qualitywhat is a watersheda watershed is the area of land that captures rain and snow then stores filters seeps or drains this water into a common waterbody marsh stream river or lake a watershed includes the network of streams that drains that surface land area and the groundwater and aquifers located underground that contribute water to those streamseast brandywine township has three main subwatersheds beaver creek culbertson run and east branch brandywine creek both beaver creek and culbertson

what is stormwaterstormwater runoff is generated when precipitation from rain and snowmelt events flows over land or impervious surfaces and does not percolate into the ground as the runoff flows over the land or impervious surfaces such as paved streets parking lots and building rooftops it accumulates debris chemicals sediment or other pollutants that can adversely affect water quality the primary method to control stormwater discharges is the use of best management practices bmps why is stormwater management importantunlike water that enters our municipal sewage system stormwater is not cleaned and treated at a wastewater plant before it reenters our streams and waterways stormwater runoff from roads and other impervious areas comes into contact with pollutants and allows those pollutants into our waters it is essential that municipalities put in place a focused stormwater management program swmp to combat polluted stormwater runoffpolluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4s from which it is often discharged untreated into local waterbodies to help to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped into an ms4 operators must obtain a national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit through the department of environmental protection dep and develop a stormwater management programms4

practices are listed and explainedhow can you helpstart by creating stormwaterfriendly lawns and gardens when the amount of rain falling exceeds the lands ability to absorb it the result is stormwater runoff without treatment stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment runoff can carry chemicals metals bacteria viruses organic compounds and other pollutants directly into creeks lakes rivers and streams runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding even during a typical pennsylvania stormclearly then what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water that means everyone not just government plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries this summer homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens and lawns are stormwaterfriendly there are many ways you can protect water quality by preventing stormwater pollution including never dump anything in storm drains streams wetlands or lakesclean up pet wastereduce the use of herbicide pesticide and fertilizerrevegetate bare spots in your yard to reduce erosionreport illicit discharges to east brandywine townshiphave your septic tank pumped and inspected regularlycheck your car for leaks and recycle your motor oil properly dispose of yard wastethe stormwaterfriendly garden home gardens can contribute considerable nutrients and other pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly this mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticidesfertilizers instead of using chemical fertilizers give organic alternatives such as compost and manure a try compost a doityourself fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow when using organic fertilizers be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoffpesticides many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem if one is posing a problem however identify the exact pest you have and research the nonchemical alternatives to controlling it pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater possibly contaminate drinking supplies and hurt downstream ecosystemsthe stormwaterfriendly lawnthe following lawncare steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners set your mower height to inches or higher taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system which absorbs more water and prevents erosion deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property a mulchmower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn the clippings decompose quickly provide important nutrients for your lawn and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers if mulching with your clippings is not possible bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material thats created as a fertilizer later figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems however if your lawn is thin or has bare spots you may not have a choice since a dense vegetated cover is the most stormwaterfriendly lawn there are no onesizefitsall guidelines when it comes to fertilizer homeowners needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and ph and nutrient levels in fact soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from micronutrient deficiency a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate identifying your lawns needs first will reduce unnecessary applications create a healthier lawn faster and reduce your longterm costs if fertilizer is needed maximize the benefits of slowrelease nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications typically called water insoluble nitrogen or win on fertilizer bags slowrelease nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation this type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring instead of the fall to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season another tip homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in march to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after october fertilizing during a lawns dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active do not fertilize or use pesticides within to feet of a stream keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways also if you live near a stream consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead to learn more about these buffers visit wwwstormwaterallianceforthebayorg and click on structural bmps also when youre done applying fertilizer immediately sweep any granulated chemicals off hard surfaces and back onto your lawn your walkway driveway patio or local road is often a quick route to the drainage pipes that discharge into local streamsin the long run little actions such as taking a stormwaterfriendly approach to your garden and lawn will have a big impact as all of them work together to protect our waters qualitywhat is a watersheda watershed is the area of land that captures rain and snow then stores filters seeps or drains this water into a common waterbody marsh stream river or lake a watershed includes the network of streams that drains that surface land area and the

space committee open space committee committee history the open space committee was created by the board of supervisors in with the charter to help identify potential openspace properties and explain the conservation options to those property owners it also works with the board of supervisors and township administration to develop procedures to maintain and acquire open spacein november east brandywine voters by a nearly to margin approved a referendum to increase the earned income tax by oneeighth of to finance the preservation of open space within the township based on this dedicated funding source the township supervisors floated a bond issue in that included $ million dedicated for open space preservation expendituresin after months of negotiation the first payoff from the voterapproved plan to preserve open space became a reality using grants from the chester county preservation partnership program totaling approximately half of the purchase price and open space funds the township purchased the conservation easement on acres of fields and woods fronting dowlin forge and rock raymond roads as part of the deal the township also purchased a nearby twoacre lot on dowlin forge road for future trail access and a small park since then the township has acquired more property easements and additional fee simple properties the total land preserved through the open space program is over acres state and county grants have covered almost half of the cost of preserving this land current activitiesbecause of the sensitivity of its discussions with landowners most of the open space committees deliberations take place in executive session as a result there has been little publicity about its work the committee is always interested in considering proposals from residents who wish to preserve their land please contact township staff at so they may direct your inquiry to the committeeopen space committee representatives also attend township planning commission meetings to provide feedback on new development proposals and encourage adoption of open spacefriendly ordinances that allow development to the same density but promote more creative use of a property

stormwaterfriendly lawns and gardens when the amount of rain falling exceeds the lands ability to absorb it the result is stormwater runoff without treatment stormwater that runs from the land into our waterways can be unhealthy for people and bad for the environment runoff can carry chemicals metals bacteria viruses organic compounds and other pollutants directly into creeks lakes rivers and streams runoff can also cause severe erosion and flooding even during a typical pennsylvania stormclearly then what we do on the land impacts the quality of our water that means everyone not just government plays a role in protecting this valuable resource by reducing runoff and the pollutants it carries this summer homeowners can take steps to help with the effort by making sure their gardens

pollutants to waterways if not cared for responsibly this mainly applies to fertilizers and pesticidesfertilizers instead of using chemical fertilizers give organic alternatives such as compost and manure a try compost a doityourself fertilizer that can be created from such things as vegetable scraps and garden clippings contains the nutrients that help your vegetables grow when using organic fertilizers be sure to apply them directly to the ground before planting the vegetables to prevent runoffpesticides many insects are harmless to people and play an important role in maintaining a healthy lawn or garden ecosystem if one is posing a problem however identify the exact pest you have and research the nonchemical alternatives to controlling it pesticides should be a last resort because they could infiltrate groundwater possibly contaminate drinking supplies and hurt downstream ecosystemsthe stormwaterfriendly lawnthe following lawncare steps will not only help to protect local streams and rivers but also result in cost savings for homeowners set your mower height to inches or higher taller grass slows the runoff and produces a deeper and denser root system which absorbs more water and prevents erosion deeper roots also reduce the need for watering during droughts and suppress weeds from growing up around them keep grass clippings and chopped leaves on your property a mulchmower is ideal for retaining and spreading clippings on your lawn the clippings decompose quickly provide important nutrients for your lawn and settle to create an organic layer on the soil that encourages stormwater infiltration using this mulch may also reduce or eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizers if mulching with your clippings is not possible bag and store them in a compost area and then use the organic material thats created as a fertilizer later figure out if you really need to fertilize your lawn foregoing fertilizer is ideal for the health of local waterways and ecosystems however if your lawn is thin or has bare spots you may not have a choice since a dense vegetated cover is the most stormwaterfriendly lawn there are no onesizefitsall guidelines when it comes to fertilizer homeowners needs vary drastically based on the soil texture and ph and nutrient levels in fact soil tests may reveal that your lawn is suffering from micronutrient deficiency a problem that standard chemical fertilizers may not alleviate identifying your lawns needs first will reduce unnecessary applications create a healthier lawn faster and reduce your longterm costs if fertilizer is needed maximize the benefits of slowrelease nitrogen and minimize the number of chemical applications typically called water insoluble nitrogen or win on fertilizer bags slowrelease nitrogen limits nutrient runoff and exportation this type of fertilizer should be applied to your lawn in the spring instead of the fall to provide a steady source of nutrients throughout the growing season another tip homeowners should wait until the grass begins growing in march to fertilize and then stop fertilizing after october fertilizing during a lawns dormant season increases the risk that the chemicals will run off into streams or leach into your water table because the root systems are less active do not fertilize or use pesticides within to feet of a stream keeping this distance will help keep chemicals out of waterways also if you live near a stream consider establishing a natural riparian buffer there instead to learn more about these buffers visit

space committee open space committee committee history the open space committee was created by the board of supervisors in with the charter to help identify potential openspace properties and explain the conservation options to those property owners it also works with the board of supervisors and township administration to develop procedures to maintain and acquire open spacein november east brandywine voters by a nearly to margin approved a referendum to increase the earned income tax by oneeighth of to finance the preservation of open space within the township based on this dedicated funding source the township supervisors floated a bond issue in that included $ million dedicated for open space preservation expendituresin after months of negotiation the first payoff from the voterapproved plan to preserve open space became a reality using grants from the chester county preservation partnership program totaling approximately half of the purchase price and open space funds the township purchased the conservation easement on acres of fields and woods fronting dowlin forge and rock raymond roads as part of the deal the township also purchased a nearby twoacre lot on dowlin forge road for future trail access and a small park since then the township has acquired more property easements and additional fee simple properties the total land preserved through the open space program is over acres state and county grants have covered almost half of the cost of preserving this land current activitiesbecause of the sensitivity of its discussions with landowners most of the open space committees deliberations take place in executive session as a result there has been little publicity about its work the committee is always interested in considering proposals from residents who wish to preserve their land please contact township staff at so they may direct your inquiry to the committeeopen space committee representatives also attend township planning commission meetings to provide feedback on new development proposals and encourage adoption of open spacefriendly ordinances that allow development to the same density but promote more creative use of a property
